By means of this little Instructor, the reader is not only made acquainted with the chief Contents of every Chapter, but likewise with the number of chapters in every Book. This methodical arrangement is as follows:<p>Every Book <i>that exceeds five Chapters</i> is divided into Stanzas, each Stanza, acrostic-like, beginning with A, B, C, &amp;c. the Stanzas contain four lines each, and every line is a Chapter (except otherwise distinguished, as the Chapters are numbered in the margin by figures); thus B, beginning the second Stanza and fifth line, is the fifth Chapter, C the 9th, D the 13th, E the 17th, &amp;c. as far as N, which is the 49th Chapter, no Book containing more than 52, except the PROPHECY of ISAIAH, which runs four letters more, O, P, Q, and R; likewise the Book of PSALMS, being 150, which are divided into three alphabets, not exceeding N, and containing 50 each. Those Books which <i>do not exceed five chapters</i>, viz. RUTH, LAMENTATIONS, JOEL, OBADIAH, &amp;c. are without this method, which do not require it, and are consequently expressed in one Stanza, sometimes exceeding four lines.<p>In the historical books, the contents of every chapter is as fully expressed as the narrow limits of <i>one line</i> will admit; and the PSALMS, which have letters expressive of the occasions of them, are by <i>those</i> distinguished: but the other PSALMS, as also the PROVERBS, ECCLESIASTES, &amp;c. consisting of various and unconnected Sentences, and not being reducible to any certain head, are only characterized by some remarkable passage in them.<p>This novel and curious arrangement will, it is presumed, gratify the taste of young readers, and not only give them a relish for the Sacred Volume, but even assist their memories when duly acquainted with it.<p>Any person desirous of committing this JUVENILE BIBLE to memory (which may be done in a month, or less) should first learn perfectly the name of all the Books, and the numbers of the chapters in each Book, on the back of the title-page; then observe A stands for 1, B 5, C 9, D 13, E 17, F 21, G 25, H 29, I 33, K 37, L 41, M 45, N 49. When it is known what number every letter denotes, the number of the chapter that begins with that letter is known by it; for example, if you know the letter B stands for 5, then when you hear this line, "Before the flood man's life was long," you can soon tell it is the 5th chapter. If it be asked, what are the contents of the 5th chapter of Genesis, you answer with the above line, and so of the rest.<p>The three last lines of every Stanza depend upon the first line of it; so that if the number of the first line is known, it is easy to know the number of the rest: for instance, if you know that "Each male of Abram circumcis'd" is the 17th of Genesis, then it follows "He angels entertains" is the 18th; "Sees Sodom's flame God's wrath proclaim" is the 19th; "His wife his sister feigns" is the 20th.<p>This work is designed to promote the knowledge and practice of the Holy Scriptures—and when presents are made by Parents, or promiscuously awarded by Schools, let the JUVENILE BIBLE be always the <i>first</i> gift: but no portion of it should ever be allotted as a <i>Task</i>; the Author of this Work being well convinced, it is owing to the modern and <i>impious</i> mode of Education, compelling Children to learn Collects, chapters in the Bible, Hymns, &amp;c. as occasional Exercises, and frequently <i>by way of Punishment</i>, that the Word of God is not heard and read with that satisfaction it always should be.<hr><h3><i><a id=Genesis>GENESIS</a></i></h3><pre style=font-family:serif> 1 All things created Moses writes,
 2     And Paradise displays,
 3   Tells Adam's fall, which ruin'd all:
 4     Cain righteous Abel slays

 5 Before the flood, Man's life was long,
 6     Noah the ark doth frame;
 7   The world is drown'd, eight favour found,
 8     Out of the ark they came.

 9 Covenant of rain-bow; Noah drunk—
10     His family's increase;
11   They Babel rear, confounded are.
12     Abram is call'd in grace;

13 Departs from Lot: again is blessed,
14     'Gainst four kings doth prevail.
15   A numerous feed is promised.
16     Hagar bears Ishmael.

17 Each male of Abram circumcis'd,
18     He angels entertains;
19   Sees Sodom's flame God's wrath proclaim,
20     His wife his sister feigns.

21 Feasting and mirth for Isaac's birth;
22     God claims, but saves his life;
23   Machpelah's cave is Sarah's grave,
24     Rebeckah's Isaac's wife.

25 Good Abraham's death; Rebeckah's twins,
26     Isaac his wife denies;
27   Jacob by wiles Isaac beguiles,
28     To Padan-Aram flies.

29 He Rachel weds, and Leah beds,
30     Grows rich by cunning flight;
31   From Laban he doth quickly flee,
32     Wrestles with God all night.

33 Jacob and Esau friendly meet,
34     Fair Dinah's foul disgrace;
35   Benjamin's birth is Rachel's death,
36     The dukes of Esau's race.

37 Kind Joseph in a pit and fold,
38     To Jude twins Temar bears;
39   Joseph the chaste in prison cast,
40     To servants dreams declares.

41 Learns Pharaoh's dreams, and is advanc'd,
42     He takes his brethren up;
43   Them come again, doth entertain,
44     But stops them with his cup;

45 Makes himself known: for Jacob sends,
46     He with his house comes down;
47   In Goshen has a dwelling place,
48     Makes Joseph's sons his own.

49 Next blesseth all his sons and dies;
50     To Canaan is convey'd:
          And thus in this book Genesis,
            You fifty chapters read.</pre><hr><h3><i><a id=Exodus>EXODUS</a></i></h3><pre style=font-family:serif> 1 All Hebrew males were to be drown'd.
 2     Moses born, sav'd in th' Ark;
 3   From bush on flame is told God's name,
 4     And wonders sent to work.

 5 By Pharoah Israel's task'd, and cries,
 6     JEHOVAH comfort speaks.
 7   Moses the flood doth turn to blood;
 8     Frogs, lice, and flies he makes.

 9 Contagious murrain, boil, and hail,
10     Locusts and darkness reign;
11   Bids jewels borrow against the morrow,
12     Jews expell'd, first-born slain.

13 Dismissed they march with Joseph's bones,
14     Pharoah pursues, is drown'd;
15   At first they sing; then murmuring,
16     Quails sent and manna found.

17 Even the rock affords them drink
18     Jethro to scheme is driven;
19   God's thunders make mount Sinai quake,
20     The Ten Commandments given.

21 For servants, and man-slayers, laws,
22     With many more besides;
23   The seventh-years rest.  Three yearly feasts,
24     Moses in mount abides.

25 Gifts ask'd for tent, ark, mercy-seat,
26     Boards, curtains, bars, and vail,
27   Oil, altar, court, with hangings for't,
28     Priests robes and pectoral [<a href=#fn1note id=fn1 class=pginternal>1</a>]

29 How priests must consecrated be,
30     Anointed and perfum'd.
31   Bezaleel inspir'd with skill,
32     The golden calf's consum'd.

33 Jehovah's anger Moses stays,
34     New tables made and brought;
35   The people bring free-offering;
36     Boards, curtains, bars are wrought.

37 Knops, flowers, ark, table, mercy-seat,
38     And altar are prepar'd;
39   Priests garments too doth Moses view,
40     The tabernacle's rear'd.

[<a href=#fn1 id=fn1note class=pginternal>1</a>] The breast-plate of judgment for the High-Priest</pre><hr><h3><i><a id=Leviticus>LEVITICUS</a></i></h3><pre style=font-family:serif> 1 A Ritual of burnt-offerings,
 2     Meat-off'rings, ordinance;
 3   Off'rings of peace, and sacrifice,
 4     For sins of ignorance.

 5 Burnt-offerings for sins unknown,
 6     For sins premeditated;
 7   Off'rings of peace, and trespasses,
 8     Aaron is consecrated.

 9 Confirm'd is Aaron by God's flame,
10     Strange fire his wrath excites;
11   What sorts of meat may not be eat,
12     For child-birth the due rites.

13 Directions leprosy to know,
14     To cleanse it in what case;
15   Off'rings for less uncleannesses,
16     High priest in holy place.

17 Eating of blood prohibited,
18     Unlawful marriage blam'd;
19   Laws manifold again are told,
20     And shameful sins are nam'd.

21 Forbidden priests to mourn are,
22     Uncleannesses disowned;
23   Sabbaths of rest, and yearly feasts,
24     Blasphemers to be stoned.

25 Great seventh-year-sabbath: jubilee,
26     Blessings and curses given;
27   Vows how esteemed, and how redeem'd.
            Here chapters twenty-seven.</pre><hr><h3><i><a id=Numbers>NUMBERS</a></i></h3><pre style=font-family:serif> 1 All Israel number'd by their tribes,
 2     To each their place assign'd;
 3   Levites succeed in first-born stead,
 4     Their services defin'd.

 5 By what rules jealousy was try'd,
 6     The Naz'rites law is stated
 7   Princes oblation at Dedication [<a href=#fn2note id=fn2 class=pginternal>2</a>].
 8     The Levites consecrated.

 9 Cloud guides them: passover renew'd,
10     Two silver trumpets sound;
11   The people lust; quails fall like dust,
12     Miriam is leprous found.

13 Deceitful spies spread false reports,
14     Great murmurings which raise;
15   Breaker of sabbath ston'd to death,
16     Korah's rebellious ways.

17 End strife doth Aaron's budding rod,
18     Priest's charge and salary; [<a href=#fn3note id=fn3 class=pginternal>3</a>]
19   Water with ashes the unclean washes,
20     Miriam and Aaron die.

21 Fierce fiery serpents bite the Jews,
22     Balaam's ass reproves him;
23   In vain his skill to curse Israel,
24     To bless the spirit moves him.

25 Good Phinehas' zeal God's wrath atones,
26     Old race all dead but two;
27   In Moses room must Joshua come,
28     Continual offerings due.

29 High offerings for set holy-days,
30     What vows do bind, what not;
31   Revenge on Midian: Balaam slain
32     Both Gad's and Reuben's lot.

33 Israelites journeys forty-two,
34     How Canaan was divided;
35   Six refuge-towns and Levites bounds,
36     Zelophehad's case decided.

[<a href=#fn2 id=fn2note class=pginternal>2</a>] Of the Tabernacle.
[<a href=#fn3 id=fn3note class=pginternal>3</a>] Their part or portion of all offerings, their wages, or dues.</pre><hr><h3><i><a id=Deuteronomy>DEUTERONOMY</a></i></h3><pre style=font-family:serif> 1 Acts of the Hebrews Moses writes;
 2     How Sihon's kingdom fell;

  I fly to thee my Lord,
And not a glimpse of hope appears,
  But in thy written word.

The volume of my Father's grace;
  Does all my griefs asswage;
Here I behold my Saviour's face
  Almost in every page.

This is the field where hidden lies,
  The pearl of price unknown,
That Merchant is divinely wise
  Who makes the pearl his own.

Here consecrated water flows
  To quench my thirst of sin;
Here the fair tree of knowledge grows,
  Nor danger dwells therein.

This is the Judge that ends the strife
  Where wit and reason fail;
My guide to everlasting life,
  Through all this gloomy vale.

O may thy counsels, mighty God,
  My roving feet command,
Nor I forsake the happy road,
  That leads to thy right-hand.</pre><hr><h3><i>The UNIVERSAL PRAYER,</i></h3><h4><i>By Mr. POPE.</i></h4><pre style=font-family:serif>FATHER of All! in ev'ry Age,
  In ev'ry Clime ador'd,
By Saint, by Savage, and by Sage,
  Jehovah, Jove, or Lord!

Thou Great First Cause, least understood:
  Who all my Sense confin'd
To know but this, that Thou art Good,
  And that myself am blind;

Yet gave me, in this dark Estate,
  To see the Good from Ill;
And binding Nature fast in Fate,
  Left free the human Will.

What Conscience dictates to be done,
  Or warns me not to do,
This, teach me more than hell to shun,
  That, more than heav'n pursue.

What Blessings thy free Bounty gives,
  Let me not cast away;
For God is paid when Man receives,
  T'enjoy is to obey.

Yet not to Earth's contracted Span
  Thy goodness let me bound,
Or think Thee Lord alone of Man,
  When thousand Worlds are round:

Let not this weak, unknowing hand
  Presume thy bolts to throw,
And deal damnation round the land,
  On each I judge thy Foe.

If I am right, thy grace impart,
  Still in the right to stay;
If I am wrong, oh teach my heart
  To find that better way.

Save me alike from foolish Pride,
  Or impious Discontent,
At aught thy wisdom has deny'd,
  Or aught thy Goodness lent.

Teach me to feel another's Woe,
  To hide the Fault I see;
That Mercy I to others show,
  That Mercy show to me.

Mean tho' I am, not wholly so,
  Since quick'ned by thy Breath:
Oh lead me wheresoe'er I go,
  Thro' this day's Life or Death.

This day, be Bread and Peace my Lot:
  All else beneath the Sun,
Thou know'st if best bestow'd or not,
  And let Thy Will be done.

To thee, whose Temple is all Space,
  Whose Altar, Earth, Sea, Skies!
One Chorus let all Being raise!
  All Nature's Incense rise!</pre><h5>THE END.</h5><hr><p>Printed by M.
