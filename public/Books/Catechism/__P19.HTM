<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Paragraph 4. THE CREATOR</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>279
&quot;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-9G href="__P19.HTM#$9G">116</a></sup></font>
Holy Scripture begins with these solemn words. the profession of faith takes them
up when it confesses that God the Father almighty is &quot;Creator of heaven
and earth&quot; (Apostles' Creed), &quot;of all that is, seen and unseen&quot;
(Nicene Creed). We shall speak first of the Creator, then of creation and
finally of the fall into sin from which Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came to
raise us up again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>280
Creation is the foundation of &quot;all God's saving plans,&quot; the
&quot;beginning of the history of salvation&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-9H href="__P19.HTM#$9H">117</a></sup></font> that culminates in
Christ. Conversely, the mystery of Christ casts conclusive light on the mystery
of creation and reveals the end for which &quot;in the beginning God created
the heavens and the earth&quot;: from the beginning, God envisaged the glory of
the new creation in Christ.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-9I href="__P19.HTM#$9I">118</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>281
And so
the readings of the Easter Vigil, the celebration of the new creation in
Christ, begin with the creation account; likewise in the Byzantine liturgy, the
account of creation always constitutes the first reading at the vigils of the
great feasts of the Lord. According to ancient witnesses the instruction of
catechumens for Baptism followed the same itinerary.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-9J href="__P19.HTM#$9J">119</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I.
CATECHESIS ON CREATION</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>282
Catechesis on creation is of major importance. It concerns the very foundations
of human and Christian life: for it makes explicit the response of the
Christian faith to the basic question that men of all times have asked
themselves:<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-9K href="__P19.HTM#$9K">120</a></sup></font> &quot;Where do we come from?&quot; &quot;Where are we
going?&quot; &quot;What is our origin?&quot; &quot;What is our end?&quot;
&quot;Where does everything that exists come from and where is it going?&quot;
the two questions, the first about the origin and the second about the end, are
inseparable. They are decisive for the meaning and orientation of our life and
actions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>283
The
question about the origins of the world and of man has been the object of many
scientific studies which have splendidly enriched our knowledge of the age and
dimensions of the cosmos, the development of life-forms and the appearance of
man. These discoveries invite us to even greater admiration for the greatness
of the Creator, prompting us to give him thanks for all his works and for the
understanding and wisdom he gives to scholars and researchers. With Solomon
they can say: &quot;It is he who gave me unerring knowledge of what exists, to
know the structure of the world and the activity of the elements. . . for
wisdom, the fashioner of all things, taught me.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-9L href="__P19.HTM#$9L">121</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>284
The
great interest accorded to these studies is strongly stimulated by a question
of another order, which goes beyond the proper domain of the natural sciences.
It is not only a question of knowing when and how the universe arose
physically, or when man appeared, but rather of discovering the meaning of such
an origin: is the universe governed by chance, blind fate, anonymous necessity,
or by a transcendent, intelligent and good Being called &quot;God&quot;? and if
the world does come from God's wisdom and goodness, why is there evil? Where
does it come from? Who is responsible for it? Is there any liberation from it?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>285
Since
the beginning the Christian faith has been challenged by responses to the
question of origins that differ from its own. Ancient religions and cultures
produced many myths concerning origins. Some philosophers have said that
everything is God, that the world is God, or that the development of the world
is the development of God (Pantheism). Others have said that the world is a
necessary emanation arising from God and returning to him. Still others have
affirmed the existence of two eternal principles, Good and Evil, Light and
Darkness, locked, in permanent conflict (Dualism, Manichaeism). According to
some of these conceptions, the world (at least the physical world) is evil, the
product of a fall, and is thus to be rejected or left behind (Gnosticism). Some
admit that the world was made by God, but as by a watch-maker who, once he has
made a watch, abandons it to itself (Deism). Finally, others reject any
transcendent origin for the world, but see it as merely the interplay of matter
that has always existed (Materialism). All these attempts bear witness to the
permanence and universality of the question of origins. This inquiry is
distinctively human.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>286
Human intelligence is surely already capable of finding a response to the
question of origins. the existence of God the Creator can be known with
certainty through his works, by the light of human reason,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-9M href="__P19.HTM#$9M">122</a></sup></font> even if
this knowledge is often obscured and disfigured by error. This is why faith comes
to confirm and enlighten reason in the correct understanding of this truth:
&quot;By faith we understand that the world was created by the word of God, so
that what is seen was made out of things which do not appear.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-9N href="__P19.HTM#$9N">123</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>287
The truth about creation is so important for all of human life that God in his
tenderness wanted to reveal to his People everything that is salutary to know
on the subject. Beyond the natural knowledge that every man can have of the
Creator,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-9O href="__P19.HTM#$9O">124</a></sup></font> God progressively revealed to Israel the mystery of
creation. He who chose the patriarchs, who brought Israel out of Egypt, and who
by choosing Israel created and formed it, this same God reveals himself as the
One to whom belong all the peoples of the earth, and the whole earth itself; he
is the One who alone &quot;made heaven and earth&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-9P href="__P19.HTM#$9P">125</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>288
Thus the revelation of creation is inseparable from the revelation and forging
of the covenant of the one God with his People. Creation is revealed as the
first step towards this covenant, the first and universal witness to God's
all-powerful love.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-9Q href="__P19.HTM#$9Q">126</a></sup></font> and so, the truth of creation is also expressed
with growing vigour in the message of the prophets, the prayer of the psalms
and the liturgy, and in the wisdom sayings of the Chosen People.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-9R href="__P19.HTM#$9R">127</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>289
Among all the Scriptural texts about creation, the first three chapters of
Genesis occupy a unique place. From a literary standpoint these texts may have
had diverse sources. the inspired authors have placed them at the beginning of
Scripture to express in their solemn language the truths of creation - its
origin and its end in God, its order and goodness, the vocation of man, and
finally the drama of sin and the hope of salvation. Read in the light of
Christ, within the unity of Sacred Scripture and in the living Tradition of the
Church, these texts remain the principal source for catechesis on the mysteries
of the &quot;beginning&quot;: creation, fall, and promise of salvation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>II. CREATION
- WORK OF THE HOLY TRINITY</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>290
&quot;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth&quot;:<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-9S href="__P19.HTM#$9S">128</a></sup></font>
three things are affirmed in these first words of Scripture: the eternal God
gave a beginning to all that exists outside of himself; he alone is Creator
(the verb &quot;create&quot; - Hebrew bara - always has God for its subject).
the totality of what exists (expressed by the formula &quot;the heavens and the
earth&quot;) depends on the One who gives it being.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>291
&quot;In the beginning was the Word. . . and the Word was God. . . all things
were made through him, and without him was not anything made that was
made.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-9T href="__P19.HTM#$9T">129</a></sup></font> The New Testament reveals that God created everything by
the eternal Word, his beloved Son. In him &quot;all things were created, in
heaven and on earth.. . all things were created through him and for him. He is
before all things, and in him all things hold together.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-9U href="__P19.HTM#$9U">130</a></sup></font> The
Church's faith likewise confesses the creative action of the Holy Spirit, the
&quot;giver of life&quot;, &quot;the Creator Spirit&quot; (Veni, Creator
Spiritus), the &quot;source of every good&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-9V href="__P19.HTM#$9V">131</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>292
The Old Testament suggests and the New Covenant reveals the creative action of
the Son and the Spirit,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-9W href="__P19.HTM#$9W">132</a></sup></font> inseparably one with that of the Father.
This creative co-operation is clearly affirmed in the Church's rule of faith:
&quot;There exists but one God. . . he is the Father, God, the Creator, the
author, the giver of order. He made all things by himself, that is, by his Word
and by his Wisdom&quot;, &quot;by the Son and the Spirit&quot; who, so to
speak, are &quot;his hands&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-9X href="__P19.HTM#$9X">133</a></sup></font> Creation is the common work of the
Holy Trinity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>III.
&quot;THE WORLD WAS CREATED FOR THE GLORY OF GOD&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>293
Scripture and Tradition never cease to teach and celebrate this fundamental
truth: &quot;The world was made for the glory of God.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-9Y href="__P19.HTM#$9Y">134</a></sup></font> St.
Bonaventure explains that God created all things &quot;not to increase his
glory, but to show it forth and to communicate it&quot;,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-9Z href="__P19.HTM#$9Z">135</a></sup></font> for God has
no other reason for creating than his love and goodness: &quot;Creatures came
into existence when the key of love opened his hand.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-A0 href="__P19.HTM#$A0">136</a></sup></font> The First
Vatican Council explains:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>This one, true God, of his own
goodness and &quot;almighty power&quot;, not for increasing his own beatitude,
nor for attaining his perfection, but in order to manifest this perfection
through the benefits which he bestows on creatures, with absolute freedom of
counsel &quot;and from the beginning of time, made out of nothing both orders
of creatures, the spiritual and the corporeal. . .&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-A1 href="__P19.HTM#$A1">137</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>294
The glory of God consists in the realization of this manifestation and
communication of his goodness, for which the world was created. God made us
&quot;to be his sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will,
to the praise of his glorious grace&quot;,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-A2 href="__P19.HTM#$A2">138</a></sup></font> for &quot;the glory of
God is man fully alive; moreover man's life is the vision of God: if God's
revelation through creation has already obtained life for all the beings that
dwell on earth, how much more will the Word's manifestation of the Father
obtain life for those who see God.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-A3 href="__P19.HTM#$A3">139</a></sup></font> The ultimate purpose of
creation is that God &quot;who is the creator of all things may at last become
&quot;all in all&quot;, thus simultaneously assuring his own glory and our beatitude.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-A4 href="__P19.HTM#$A4">140</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>IV. THE
MYSTERY OF CREATION</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>God creates
by wisdom and love</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>295
We believe that God created the world according to his wisdom.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-A5 href="__P19.HTM#$A5">141</a></sup></font> It is
not the product of any necessity whatever, nor of blind fate or chance. We believe
that it proceeds from God's free will; he wanted to make his creatures share in
his being, wisdom and goodness: &quot;For you created all things, and by your
will they existed and were created.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-A6 href="__P19.HTM#$A6">142</a></sup></font> Therefore the Psalmist
exclaims: &quot;O LORD, how manifold are your works! In wisdom you have made
them all&quot;; and &quot;The LORD is good to all, and his compassion is over
all that he has made.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-A7 href="__P19.HTM#$A7">143</a></sup></font> God creates &quot;out of nothing&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>296
We believe that God needs no pre-existent thing or any help in order to create,
nor is creation any sort of necessary emanation from the divine
substance.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-A8 href="__P19.HTM#$A8">144</a></sup></font> God creates freely &quot;out of nothing&quot;:<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-A9 href="__P19.HTM#$A9">145</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>If God had drawn the world
from pre-existent matter, what would be so extraordinary in that? A human
artisan makes from a given material whatever he wants, while God shows his
power by starting from nothing to make all he wants.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-AA href="__P19.HTM#$AA">146</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>297
Scripture bears witness to faith in creation &quot;out of nothing&quot; as a
truth full of promise and hope. Thus the mother of seven sons encourages them
for martyrdom:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>I do not know how you came
into being in my womb. It was not I who gave you life and breath, nor I who set
in order the elements within each of you. Therefore the Creator of the world,
who shaped the beginning of man and devised the origin of all things, will in
his mercy give life and breath back to you again, since you now forget
yourselves for the sake of his laws. . . Look at the heaven and the earth and
see everything that is in them, and recognize that God did not make them out of
things that existed. Thus also mankind comes into being.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-AB href="__P19.HTM#$AB">147</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>298
Since God could create everything out of nothing, he can also, through the Holy
Spirit, give spiritual life to sinners by creating a pure heart in
them,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-AC href="__P19.HTM#$AC">148</a></sup></font> and bodily life to the dead through the Resurrection. God
&quot;gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not
exist.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-AD href="__P19.HTM#$AD">149</a></sup></font> and since God was able to make light shine in darkness
by his Word, he can also give the light of faith to those who do not yet know
him.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-AE href="__P19.HTM#$AE">150</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>God creates
an ordered and good world</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>299
Because God creates through wisdom, his creation is ordered: &quot;You have arranged
all things by measure and number and weight.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-AF href="__P19.HTM#$AF">151</a></sup></font> The universe,
created in and by the eternal Word, the &quot;image of the invisible God&quot;,
is destined for and addressed to man, himself created in the &quot;image of
God&quot; and called to a personal relationship with God.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-AG href="__P19.HTM#$AG">152</a></sup></font> Our human
understanding, which shares in the light of the divine intellect, can
understand what God tells us by means of his creation, though not without great
effort and only in a spirit of humility and respect before the Creator and his
work.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-AH href="__P19.HTM#$AH">153</a></sup></font> Because creation comes forth from God's goodness, it shares in
that goodness - &quot;and God saw that it was good. . . very
good&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-AI href="__P19.HTM#$AI">154</a></sup></font>- for God willed creation as a gift addressed to man, an
inheritance destined for and entrusted to him. On many occasions the Church has
had to defend the goodness of creation, including that of the physical
world.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-AJ href="__P19.HTM#$AJ">155</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>God
transcends creation and is present to it</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>300
God is infinitely greater than all his works: &quot;You have set your glory
above the heavens.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-AK href="__P19.HTM#$AK">156</a></sup></font> Indeed, God's &quot;greatness is
unsearchable&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-AL href="__P19.HTM#$AL">157</a></sup></font> But because he is the free and sovereign
Creator, the first cause of all that exists, God is present to his creatures'
inmost being: &quot;In him we live and move and have our
being.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-AM href="__P19.HTM#$AM">158</a></sup></font> In the words of St. Augustine, God is &quot;higher than
my highest and more inward than my innermost self&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-AN href="__P19.HTM#$AN">159</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>God upholds
and sustains creation</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>301
With creation, God does not abandon his creatures to themselves. He not only
gives them being and existence, but also, and at every moment, upholds and
sustains them in being, enables them to act and brings them to their final end.
Recognizing this utter dependence with respect to the Creator is a source of
wisdom and freedom, of joy and confidence:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>For you love all things that
exist, and detest none of the things that you have made; for you would not have
made anything if you had hated it. How would anything have endured, if you had
not willed it? Or how would anything not called forth by you have been
preserved? You spare all things, for they are yours, O Lord, you who love the
living.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-AO href="__P19.HTM#$AO">160</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>V. GOD
CARRIES OUT HIS PLAN: DIVINE PROVIDENCE</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>302
Creation has its own goodness and proper perfection, but it did not spring
forth complete from the hands of the Creator. the universe was created &quot;in
a state of journeying&quot; (in statu viae) toward an ultimate perfection yet
to be attained, to which God has destined it. We call &quot;divine
providence&quot; the dispositions by which God guides his creation toward this
perfection:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>By his providence God protects
and governs all things which he has made, &quot;reaching mightily from one end
of the earth to the other, and ordering all things well&quot;. For &quot;all are
open and laid bare to his eyes&quot;, even those things which are yet to come
into existence through the free action of creatures.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-AP href="__P19.HTM#$AP">161</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>303
The witness of Scripture is unanimous that the solicitude of divine providence
is concrete and immediate; God cares for all, from the least things to the
great events of the world and its history. the sacred books powerfully affirm
God's absolute sovereignty over the course of events: &quot;Our God is in the
heavens; he does whatever he pleases.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-AQ href="__P19.HTM#$AQ">162</a></sup></font> and so it is with
Christ, &quot;who opens and no one shall shut, who shuts and no one
opens&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-AR href="__P19.HTM#$AR">163</a></sup></font> As the book of Proverbs states: &quot;Many are the
plans in the mind of a man, but it is the purpose of the LORD that will be
established.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-AS href="__P19.HTM#$AS">164</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>304
And so
we see the Holy Spirit, the principal author of Sacred Scripture, often
attributing actions to God without mentioning any secondary causes. This is not
a &quot;primitive mode of speech&quot;, but a profound way of recalling God's
primacy and absolute Lordship over history and the world,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-AT href="__P19.HTM#$AT">165</a></sup></font> and so of
educating his people to trust in him. the prayer of the Psalms is the great
school of this trust.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-AU href="__P19.HTM#$AU">166</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>305
Jesus asks for childlike abandonment to the providence of our heavenly Father
who takes care of his children's smallest needs: &quot;Therefore do not be
anxious, saying, &quot;What shall we eat?&quot; or &quot;What shall we
drink?&quot;. . . Your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. But seek
first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things shall be yours as
well.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-AV href="__P19.HTM#$AV">167</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Providence
and secondary causes</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>306
God is the sovereign master of his plan. But to carry it out he also makes use
of his creatures' co-operation. This use is not a sign of weakness, but rather
a token of almighty God's greatness and goodness. For God grants his creatures
not only their existence, but also the dignity of acting on their own, of being
causes and principles for each other, and thus of co-operating in the accomplishment
of his plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>307
To human beings God even gives the power of freely sharing in his providence by
entrusting them with the responsibility of &quot;subduing&quot; the earth and
having dominion over it.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-AW href="__P19.HTM#$AW">168</a></sup></font> God thus enables men to be intelligent and
free causes in order to complete the work of creation, to perfect its harmony
for their own good and that of their neighbours. Though often unconscious
collaborators with God's will, they can also enter deliberately into the divine
plan by their actions, their prayers and their sufferings.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-AX href="__P19.HTM#$AX">169</a></sup></font> They then
fully become &quot;God's fellow workers&quot; and co-workers for his
kingdom.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-AY href="__P19.HTM#$AY">170</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>308
The truth that God is at work in all the actions of his creatures is
inseparable from faith in God the Creator. God is the first cause who operates
in and through secondary causes: &quot;For God is at work in you, both to will
and to work for his good pleasure.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-AZ href="__P19.HTM#$AZ">171</a></sup></font> Far from diminishing the
creature's dignity, this truth enhances it. Drawn from nothingness by God's
power, wisdom and goodness, it can do nothing if it is cut off from its origin,
for &quot;without a Creator the creature vanishes.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-B0 href="__P19.HTM#$B0">172</a></sup></font> Still less
can a creature attain its ultimate end without the help of God's grace.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-B1 href="__P19.HTM#$B1">173</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Providence
and the scandal of evil</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>309
If God the Father almighty, the Creator of the ordered and good world, cares
for all his creatures, why does evil exist? To this question, as pressing as it
is unavoidable and as painful as it is mysterious, no quick answer will
suffice. Only Christian faith as a whole constitutes the answer to this
question: the goodness of creation, the drama of sin and the patient love of
God who comes to meet man by his covenants, the redemptive Incarnation of his
Son, his gift of the Spirit, his gathering of the Church, the power of the
sacraments and his call to a blessed life to which free creatures are invited
to consent in advance, but from which, by a terrible mystery, they can also
turn away in advance. There is not a single aspect of the Christian message
that is not in part an answer to the question of evil.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>310
But why did God not create a world so perfect that no evil could exist in it?
With infinite power God could always create something better.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-B2 href="__P19.HTM#$B2">174</a></sup></font> But
with infinite wisdom and goodness God freely willed to create a world &quot;in
a state of journeying&quot; towards its ultimate perfection. In God's plan this
process of becoming involves the appearance of certain beings and the disappearance
of others, the existence of the more perfect alongside the less perfect, both
constructive and destructive forces of nature. With physical good there exists
also physical evil as long as creation has not reached perfection.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-B3 href="__P19.HTM#$B3">175</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>311
Angels and men, as intelligent and free creatures, have to journey toward their
ultimate destinies by their free choice and preferential love. They can
therefore go astray. Indeed, they have sinned. Thus has moral evil,
incommensurably more harmful than physical evil, entered the world. God is in
no way, directly or indirectly, the cause of moral evil.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-B4 href="__P19.HTM#$B4">176</a></sup></font> He permits
it, however, because he respects the freedom of his creatures and,
mysteriously, knows how to derive good from it:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>For almighty God. . ., because
he is supremely good, would never allow any evil whatsoever to exist in his
works if he were not so all-powerful and good as to cause good to emerge from
evil itself.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-B5 href="__P19.HTM#$B5">177</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>312
In time we can discover that God in his almighty providence can bring a good
from the consequences of an evil, even a moral evil, caused by his creatures:
&quot;It was not you&quot;, said Joseph to his brothers, &quot;who sent me
here, but God. . . You meant evil against me; but God meant it for good, to bring
it about that many people should be kept alive.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-B6 href="__P19.HTM#$B6">178</a></sup></font> From the
greatest moral evil ever committed - the rejection and murder of God's only
Son, caused by the sins of all men - God, by his grace that &quot;abounded all
the more&quot;,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-B7 href="__P19.HTM#$B7">179</a></sup></font> brought the greatest of goods: the glorification of
Christ and our redemption. But for all that, evil never becomes a good.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>313
&quot;We know that in everything God works for good for those who love
him.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-B8 href="__P19.HTM#$B8">180</a></sup></font> The constant witness of the saints confirms this truth:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>St. Catherine of Siena said to
&quot;those who are scandalized and rebel against what happens to them&quot;:
&quot;Everything comes from love, all is ordained for the salvation of man, God
does nothing without this goal in mind.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-B9 href="__P19.HTM#$B9">181</a></sup></font> <br>
St. Thomas More, shortly before his martyrdom, consoled his daughter:
&quot;Nothing can come but that that God wills. and I make me very sure that
whatsoever that be, seem it never so bad in sight, it shall indeed be the
best.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-BA href="__P19.HTM#$BA">182</a></sup></font> <br>
Dame Julian of Norwich: &quot;Here I was taught by the grace of God that I
should steadfastly keep me in the faith... and that at the same time I should
take my stand on and earnestly believe in what our Lord shewed in this time -
that 'all manner (of) thing shall be well.'&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-BB href="__P19.HTM#$BB">183</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>314
We firmly believe that God is master of the world and of its history. But the
ways of his providence are often unknown to us. Only at the end, when our
partial knowledge ceases, when we see God &quot;face to face&quot;,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-BC href="__P19.HTM#$BC">184</a></sup></font>
will we fully know the ways by which - even through the dramas of evil and sin
- God has guided his creation to that definitive sabbath rest<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-BD href="__P19.HTM#$BD">185</a></sup></font> for
which he created heaven and earth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>IN BRIEF</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>315 In the creation of the world
and of man, God gave the first and universal witness to his almighty love and
his wisdom, the first proclamation of the &quot;plan of his loving
goodness&quot;, which finds its goal in the new creation in Christ.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>316 Though the work of creation
is attributed to the Father in particular, it is equally a truth of faith that
the Father, Son and Holy Spirit together are the one, indivisible principle of
creation.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>317 God alone created the
universe, freely, directly and without any help.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>318 No creature has the
infinite power necessary to &quot;create&quot; in the proper sense of the word,
that is, to produce and give being to that which had in no way possessed it to
call into existence &quot;out of nothing&quot;) (cf&nbsp; DS 3624).</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>319 God created the world to
show forth and communicate his glory. That his creatures should share in his
truth, goodness and beauty - this is the glory for which God created them.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>320 God created the universe
and keeps it in existence by his Word, the Son &quot;upholding the universe by
his word of power&quot; (Heb 1:3), and by his Creator
Spirit, the giver of life.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>321 Divine providence
consists of the dispositions by which God guides all his creatures with wisdom
and love to their ultimate end.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>322 Christ invites us to
filial trust in the providence of our heavenly Father (cf
Mt 6:26-34), and St. Peter the apostle
repeats: &quot;Cast all your anxieties on him, for he cares about you&quot;
(I Pt 5:7; cf. Ps
55:23).</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>323 Divine providence works
also through the actions of creatures. To human beings God grants the ability
to co-operate freely with his plans.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>324 The fact that God permits
physical and even moral evil is a mystery that God illuminates by his Son Jesus
Christ who died and rose to vanquish evil. Faith gives us the certainty that
God would not permit an evil if he did not cause a good to come from that very
evil, by ways that we shall fully know only in eternal life.</i></p>
