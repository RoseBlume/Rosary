<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>III. The Holy Spirit and the Church in the
Liturgy</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1091
In the liturgy the Holy Spirit is teacher of the faith of the People of God and
artisan of &quot;God's masterpieces,&quot; the sacraments of the New Covenant.
the desire and work of the Spirit in the heart of the Church is that we may
live from the life of the risen Christ. When the Spirit encounters in us the
response of faith which he has aroused in us, he brings about genuine
cooperation. Through it, the liturgy becomes the common work of the Holy Spirit
and the Church.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1092
In this sacramental dispensation of Christ's mystery the Holy Spirit acts in
the same way as at other times in the economy of salvation: he prepares the
Church to encounter her Lord; he recalls and makes Christ manifest to the faith
of the assembly. By his transforming power, he makes the mystery of Christ
present here and now. Finally the Spirit of communion unites the Church to the
life and mission of Christ. <br>
The Holy Spirit prepares for the reception of Christ</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1093
In the sacramental economy the Holy Spirit fulfills what was prefigured in the
Old Covenant. Since Christ's Church was &quot;prepared in marvellous fashion in
the history of the people of Israel and in the Old Covenant,&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1DX href="__P2X.HTM#$1DX">14</a></sup></font>
The Church's liturgy has retained certain elements of the worship of the Old
Covenant as integral and irreplaceable, adopting them as her own: <br>
-notably, reading the Old Testament; <br>
-praying the Psalms; <br>
-above all, recalling the saving events and significant realities which have
found their fulfillment in the mystery of Christ (promise and covenant, Exodus
and Passover, kingdom and temple, exile and return).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1094
It is on this harmony of the two Testaments that the Paschal catechesis of the
Lord is built,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1DY href="__P2X.HTM#$1DY">15</a></sup></font> and then, that of the Apostles and the Fathers of the
Church. This catechesis unveils what lay hidden under the letter of the Old
Testament: the mystery of Christ. It is called &quot;typological&quot; because
it reveals the newness of Christ on the basis of the &quot;figures&quot;
(types) which announce him in the deeds, words, and symbols of the first
covenant. By this re-reading in the Spirit of Truth, starting from Christ, the
figures are unveiled.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1DZ href="__P2X.HTM#$1DZ">16</a></sup></font> Thus the flood and Noah's ark prefigured
salvation by Baptism,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1E0 href="__P2X.HTM#$1E0">17</a></sup></font> as did the cloud and the crossing of the Red
Sea. Water from the rock was the figure of the spiritual gifts of Christ, and
manna in the desert prefigured the Eucharist, &quot;the true bread from heaven.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1E1 href="__P2X.HTM#$1E1">18</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1095
For this reason the Church, especially during Advent and Lent and above all at
the Easter Vigil, re-reads and re-lives the great events of salvation history
in the &quot;today&quot; of her liturgy. But this also demands that catechesis
help the faithful to open themselves to this spiritual understanding of the
economy of salvation as the Church's liturgy reveals it and enables us to live
it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1096
Jewish
liturgy and Christian liturgy. A better knowledge of the Jewish people's faith
and religious life as professed and lived even now can help our better
understanding of certain aspects of Christian liturgy. For both Jews and
Christians Sacred Scripture is an essential part of their respective liturgies:
in the proclamation of the Word of God, the response to this word, prayer of
praise and intercession for the living and the dead, invocation of God's mercy.
In its characteristic structure the Liturgy of the Word originates in Jewish
prayer. the Liturgy of the Hours and other liturgical texts and formularies, as
well as those of our most venerable prayers, including the Lord's Prayer, have
parallels in Jewish prayer. the Eucharistic Prayers also draw their inspiration
from the Jewish tradition. the relationship between Jewish liturgy and
Christian liturgy, but also their differences in content, are particularly
evident in the great feasts of the liturgical year, such as Passover.
Christians and Jews both celebrate the Passover. For Jews, it is the Passover
of history, tending toward the future; for Christians, it is the Passover
fulfilled in the death and Resurrection of Christ, though always in expectation
of its definitive consummation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1097
In the liturgy of the New Covenant every liturgical action, especially the
celebration of the Eucharist and the sacraments, is an encounter between Christ
and the Church. the liturgical assembly derives its unity from the
&quot;communion of the Holy Spirit&quot; who gathers the children of God into
the one Body of Christ. This assembly transcends racial, cultural, social -
indeed, all human affinities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1098
The assembly should prepare itself to encounter its Lord and to become &quot;a
people well disposed.&quot; the preparation of hearts is the joint work of the
Holy Spirit and the assembly, especially of its ministers. the grace of the
Holy Spirit seeks to awaken faith, conversion of heart, and adherence to the
Father's will. These dispositions are the precondition both for the reception
of other graces conferred in the celebration itself and the fruits of new life
which the celebration is intended to produce afterward.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Holy
Spirit recalls the mystery of Christ</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1099
The Spirit and the Church cooperate to manifest Christ and his work of
salvation in the liturgy. Primarily in the Eucharist, and by analogy in the
other sacraments, the liturgy is the memorial of the mystery of salvation. the
Holy Spirit is the Church's living memory.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1E2 href="__P2X.HTM#$1E2">19</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1100
The Word of God. the Holy Spirit first recalls the meaning of the salvation
event to the liturgical assembly by giving life to the Word of God, which is
proclaimed so that it may be received and lived:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>In the celebration of the
liturgy, Sacred Scripture is extremely important. From it come the lessons that
are read and explained in the homily and the psalms that are sung. It is from
the Scriptures that the prayers, collects, and hymns draw their inspiration and
their force, and that actions and signs derive their meaning.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1E3 href="__P2X.HTM#$1E3">20</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1101
The Holy Spirit gives a spiritual understanding of the Word of God to those who
read or hear it, according to the dispositions of their hearts. By means of the
words, actions, and symbols that form the structure of a celebration, the
Spirit puts both the faithful and the ministers into a living relationship with
Christ, the Word and Image of the Father, so that they can live out the meaning
of what they hear, contemplate, and do in the celebration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1102
&quot;By the saving word of God, faith . . . is nourished in the hearts of
believers. By this faith then the congregation of the faithful begins and
grows.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1E4 href="__P2X.HTM#$1E4">21</a></sup></font> The proclamation does not stop with a teaching; it
elicits the response of faith as consent and commitment, directed at the covenant
between God and his people. Once again it is the Holy Spirit who gives the
grace of faith, strengthens it and makes it grow in the community. the
liturgical assembly is first of all a communion in faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1103
Anamnesis. the liturgical celebration always refers to God's saving
interventions in history. &quot;The economy of Revelation is realized by deeds
and words which are intrinsically bound up with each other.... (The) words for
their part proclaim the works and bring to light the mystery they
contain.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1E5 href="__P2X.HTM#$1E5">22</a></sup></font> In the Liturgy of the Word the Holy Spirit
&quot;recalls&quot; to the assembly all that Christ has done for us. In keeping
with the nature of liturgical actions and the ritual traditions of the
churches, the celebration &quot;makes a remembrance&quot; of the marvelous
works of God in an anamnesis which may be more or less developed. the Holy
Spirit who thus awakens the memory of the Church then inspires thanksgiving and
praise (doxology).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Holy
Spirit makes present the mystery of Christ</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1104
Christian liturgy not only recalls the events that saved us but actualizes
them, makes them present. the Paschal mystery of Christ is celebrated, not
repeated. It is the celebrations that are repeated, and in each celebration
there is an outpouring of the Holy Spirit that makes the unique mystery
present.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1105
The Epiclesis (&quot;invocation upon&quot;) is the intercession in which the
priest begs the Father to send the Holy Spirit, the Sanctifier, so that the
offerings may become the body and blood of Christ and that the faithful by
receiving them, may themselves become a living offering to God.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1E6 href="__P2X.HTM#$1E6">23</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1106
Together with the anamnesis, the epiclesis is at the heart of each sacramental
celebration, most especially of the Eucharist:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You ask how the bread becomes the Body of Christ, and the wine . . . the
Blood of Christ I shall tell you: the Holy Spirit comes upon them and
accomplishes what surpasses every word and thought . . . Let it be enough for you
to understand that it is by the Holy Spirit, just as it was of the Holy Virgin
and by the Holy Spirit that the Lord, through and in himself, took
flesh.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1E7 href="__P2X.HTM#$1E7">24</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1107
The Holy Spirit's transforming power in the liturgy hastens the coming of the
kingdom and the consummation of the mystery of salvation. While we wait in hope
he causes us really to anticipate the fullness of communion with the Holy
Trinity. Sent by the Father who hears the epiclesis of the Church, the Spirit
gives life to those who accept him and is, even now, the &quot;guarantee&quot;
of their inheritance.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1E8 href="__P2X.HTM#$1E8">25</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The
communion of the Holy Spirit</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1108
In every liturgical action the Holy Spirit is sent in order to bring us into
communion with Christ and so to form his Body. the Holy Spirit is like the sap
of the Father's vine which bears fruit on its branches.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1E9 href="__P2X.HTM#$1E9">26</a></sup></font> The most
intimate cooperation of the Holy Spirit and the Church is achieved in the
liturgy. the Spirit who is the Spirit of communion, abides indefectibly in the
Church. For this reason the Church is the great sacrament of divine communion
which gathers God's scattered children together. Communion with the Holy
Trinity and fraternal communion are inseparably the fruit of the Spirit in the
liturgy.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1EA href="__P2X.HTM#$1EA">27</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1109
The epiclesis is also a prayer for the full effect of the assembly's communion
with the mystery of Christ. &quot;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the
love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1EB href="__P2X.HTM#$1EB">28</a></sup></font> have to
remain with us always and bear fruit beyond the Eucharistic celebration. the
Church therefore asks the Father to send the Holy Spirit to make the lives of
the faithful a living sacrifice to God by their spiritual transformation into
the image of Christ, by concern for the Church's unity, and by taking part in
her mission through the witness and service of charity.</p>
