Dignity of Persons</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Respect for
the souls of others: scandal</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2284
Scandal is an attitude or behavior which leads another to do evil. the person
who gives scandal becomes his neighbor's tempter. He damages virtue and
integrity; he may even draw his brother into spiritual death. Scandal is a
grave offense if by deed or omission another is deliberately led into a grave
offense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2285
Scandal takes on a particular gravity by reason of the authority of those who
cause it or the weakness of those who are scandalized. It prompted our Lord to
utter this curse: &quot;Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in
me to sin, it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened round
his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2CL href="__P80.HTM#$2CL">85</a></sup></font> Scandal is
grave when given by those who by nature or office are obliged to teach and
educate others. Jesus reproaches the scribes and Pharisees on this account: he
likens them to wolves in sheep's clothing.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2CM href="__P80.HTM#$2CM">86</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2286
Scandal can be provoked by laws or institutions, by fashion or opinion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Therefore, they are guilty of scandal who establish laws or social
structures leading to the decline of morals and the corruption of religious
practice, or to &quot;social conditions that, intentionally or not, make
Christian conduct and obedience to the Commandments difficult and practically
impossible.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2CN href="__P80.HTM#$2CN">87</a></sup></font> This is also true of business leaders who make
rules encouraging fraud, teachers who provoke their children to
anger,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2CO href="__P80.HTM#$2CO">88</a></sup></font> or manipulators of public opinion who turn it away from moral
values.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2287
Anyone who uses the power at his disposal in such a way that it leads others to
do wrong becomes guilty of scandal and responsible for the evil that he has
directly or indirectly encouraged. &quot;Temptations to sin are sure to come;
but woe to him by whom they come!&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2CP href="__P80.HTM#$2CP">89</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Respect for
health</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2288
Life and physical health are precious gifts entrusted to us by God. <br>
We must take reasonable care of them, taking into account the needs of others
and the common good. <br>
Concern for the health of its citizens requires that society help in the
attainment of living-conditions that allow them to grow and reach maturity:
food and clothing, housing, health care, basic education, employment, and
social assistance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2289
If morality requires respect for the life of the body, it does not make it an
absolute value. <br>
It rejects a neo-pagan notion that tends to promote the cult of the body, to
sacrifice everything for it's sake, to idolize physical perfection and success
at sports. <br>
By its selective preference of the strong over the weak, such a conception can
lead to the perversion of human relationships.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2290
The virtue of temperance disposes us to avoid every kind of excess: the abuse
of food, alcohol, tobacco, or medicine. Those incur grave guilt who, by
drunkenness or a love of speed, endanger their own and others' safety on the
road, at sea, or in the air.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2291
The use of drugs inflicts very grave damage on human health and life. Their
use, except on strictly therapeutic grounds, is a grave offense. Clandestine
production of and trafficking in drugs are scandalous practices. They
constitute direct co-operation in evil, since they encourage people to
practices gravely contrary to the moral law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Respect for
the person and scientific research</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2292
Scientific, medical, or psychological experiments on human individuals or
groups can contribute to healing the sick and the advancement of public health.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2293
Basic
scientific research, as well as applied research, is a significant expression
of man's dominion over creation. Science and technology are precious resources
when placed at the service of man and promote his integral development for the
benefit of all. By themselves however they cannot disclose the meaning of
existence and of human progress. Science and technology are ordered to man,
from whom they take their origin and development; hence they find in the person
and in his moral values both evidence of their purpose and awareness of their
limits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2294
It is
an illusion to claim moral neutrality in scientific research and its
applications. On the other hand, guiding principles cannot be inferred from
simple technical efficiency, or from the usefulness accruing to some at the
expense of others or, even worse, from prevailing ideologies. Science and
technology by their very nature require unconditional respect for fundamental
moral criteria. They must be at the service of the human person, of his
inalienable rights, of his true and integral good, in conformity with the plan
and the will of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2295
Research or experimentation on the human being cannot legitimate acts that are
in themselves contrary to the dignity of persons and to the moral law. the
subjects' potential consent does not justify such acts. Experimentation on
human beings is not morally legitimate if it exposes the subject's life or
physical and psychological integrity to disproportionate or avoidable risks.
Experimentation on human beings does not conform to the dignity of the person
if it takes place without the informed consent of the subject or those who
legitimately speak for him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2296
Organ
transplants are in conformity with the moral law if the physical and
psychological dangers and risks incurred by the donor are proportionate to the
good sought for the recipient. Donation of organs after death is a noble and
meritorious act and is to be encouraged as a manifestation of generous
solidarity. It is not morally acceptable if the donor or those who legitimately
speak for him have not given their explicit consent.<br>
It is furthermore morally inadmissible directly to bring about the disabling
mutilation or death of a human being, even in order to delay the death of other
persons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Respect for
bodily integrity</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2297
Kidnapping and hostage taking bring on a reign of terror; by means of threats
they subject their victims to intolerable pressures. They are morally wrong.
Terrorism threatens, wounds, and kills indiscriminately; it is gravely against
justice and charity.<br>
Torture which uses physical or moral violence to extract confessions, punish
the guilty, frighten opponents, or satisfy hatred is contrary to respect for
the person and for human dignity. Except when performed for strictly
therapeutic medical reasons, directly intended amputations, mutilations, and
sterilizations performed on innocent persons are against the moral
law.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2CQ href="__P80.HTM#$2CQ">90</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2298
In
times past, cruel practices were commonly used by legitimate governments to
maintain law and order, often without protest from the Pastors of the Church,
who themselves adopted in their own tribunals the prescriptions of Roman law
concerning torture. Regrettable as these facts are, the Church always taught
the duty of clemency and mercy. She forbade clerics to shed blood. In recent
times it has become evident that these cruel practices were neither necessary
for public order, nor in conformity with the legitimate rights of the human
person. On the contrary, these practices led to ones even more degrading. It is
necessary to work for their abolition. We must pray for the victims and their
tormentors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Respect for
the dead</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2299
The dying should be given attention and care to help them live their last
moments in dignity and peace. They will be helped by the prayer of their
relatives, who must see to it that the sick receive at the proper time the
sacraments that prepare them to meet the living God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2300
The bodies of the dead must be treated with respect and charity, in faith and
hope of the Resurrection. the burial of the dead is a corporal work of
mercy;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2CR href="__P80.HTM#$2CR">91</a></sup></font> it honors the children of God, who are temples of the Holy
Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2301
Autopsies
can be morally permitted for legal inquests or scientific research. the free
gift of organs after death is legitimate and can be meritorious. <br>
The Church permits cremation, provided that it does not demonstrate a denial of
faith in the resurrection of the body.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2CS href="__P80.HTM#$2CS">92</a></sup></font></p>
