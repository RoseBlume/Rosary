<p class=MsoNormal>I. THE
CHURCH - PEOPLE OF GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>781
&quot;At all times and in every race, anyone who fears God and does what is
right has been acceptable to him. He has, however, willed to make men holy and
save them, not as individuals without any bond or link between them, but rather
to make them into a people who might acknowledge him and serve him in holiness.
He therefore chose the Israelite race to be his own people and established a
covenant with it. He gradually instructed this people.... All these things,
however, happened as a preparation for and figure of that new and perfect
covenant which was to be ratified in Christ . . . the New Covenant in his
blood; he called together a race made up of Jews and Gentiles which would be
one, not according to the flesh, but in the Spirit.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-10O href="__P28.HTM#$10O">201</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Characteristics
of the People of Got</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>782
The People of God is marked by characteristics that clearly distinguish it from
all other religious, ethnic, political, or cultural groups found in history: <br>
- It is the People of God: God is not the property of any one people. But he
acquired a people for himself from those who previously were not a people:
&quot;a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-10P href="__P28.HTM#$10P">202</a></sup></font> <br>
- One becomes a member of this people not by a physical birth, but by being
&quot;born anew,&quot; a birth &quot;of water and the Spirit,&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-10Q href="__P28.HTM#$10Q">203</a></sup></font>
that is, by faith in Christ, and Baptism. <br>
- This People has for its Head Jesus the Christ (the anointed, the Messiah).
Because the same anointing, the Holy Spirit, flows from the head into the body,
this is &quot;the messianic people.&quot; <br>
- &quot;The status of this people is that of the dignity and freedom of the
sons of God, in whose hearts the Holy Spirit dwells as in a temple.&quot; <br>
- &quot;Its law is the new commandment to love as Christ loved
us.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-10R href="__P28.HTM#$10R">204</a></sup></font> This is the &quot;new&quot; law of the Holy Spirit.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-10S href="__P28.HTM#$10S">205</a></sup></font>
<br>
- Its mission is to be salt of the earth and light of the world.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-10T href="__P28.HTM#$10T">206</a></sup></font>
This people is &quot;a most sure seed of unity, hope, and salvation for the
whole human race.&quot; <br>
-Its destiny, finally, &quot;is the Kingdom of God which has been begun by God
himself on earth and which must be further extended until it has been brought
to perfection by him at the end of time.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-10U href="__P28.HTM#$10U">207</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A priestly,
prophetic, and royal people</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>783
Jesus Christ is the one whom the Father anointed with the Holy Spirit and
established as priest, prophet, and king. the whole People of God participates
in these three offices of Christ and bears the responsibilities for mission and
service that flow from them.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-10V href="__P28.HTM#$10V">208</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>784
On entering the People of God through faith and Baptism, one receives a share
in this people's unique, priestly vocation: &quot;Christ the Lord, high priest
taken from among men, has made this new people 'a kingdom of priests to God,
his Father.' the baptized, by regeneration and the anointing of the Holy
Spirit, are consecrated to be a spiritual house and a holy
priesthood.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-10W href="__P28.HTM#$10W">209</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>785
&quot;The holy People of God shares also in Christ's prophetic office,&quot;
above all in the supernatural sense of faith that belongs to the whole People,
lay and clergy, when it &quot;unfailingly adheres to this faith . . . once for
all delivered to the saints,&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-10X href="__P28.HTM#$10X">210</a></sup></font> and when it deepens its
understanding and becomes Christ's witness in the midst of this world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>786
Finally, the People of God shares in the royal office of Christ. He exercises
his kingship by drawing all men to himself through his death and
Resurrection.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-10Y href="__P28.HTM#$10Y">211</a></sup></font> Christ, King and Lord of the universe, made himself
the servant of all, for he came &quot;not to be served but to serve, and to
give his life as a ransom for many.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-10Z href="__P28.HTM#$10Z">212</a></sup></font> For the Christian,
&quot;to reign is to serve him,&quot; particularly when serving &quot;the poor
and the suffering, in whom the Church recognizes the image of her poor and suffering
founder.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-110 href="__P28.HTM#$110">213</a></sup></font> The People of God fulfills its royal dignity by a
life in keeping with its vocation to serve with Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The sign of the cross makes kings of all those reborn in Christ and the
anointing of the Holy Spirit consecrates them as priests, so that, apart from
the particular service of our ministry, all spiritual and rational Christians
are recognized as members of this royal race and sharers in Christ's priestly
office. What, indeed, is as royal for a soul as to govern the body in obedience
to God? and what is as priestly as to dedicate a pure conscience to the Lord
and to offer the spotless offerings of devotion on the altar of the
heart?<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-111 href="__P28.HTM#$111">214</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>II. THE
CHURCH - BODY OF CHRIST</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Church
is communion with Jesus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>787
From the beginning, Jesus associated his disciples with his own life, revealed
the mystery of the Kingdom to them, and gave them a share in his mission, joy,
and sufferings.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-112 href="__P28.HTM#$112">215</a></sup></font> Jesus spoke of a still more intimate communion
between him and those who would follow him: &quot;Abide in me, and I in you....
I am the vine, you are the branches.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-113 href="__P28.HTM#$113">216</a></sup></font> and he proclaimed a
mysterious and real communion between his own body and ours: &quot;He who eats
my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-114 href="__P28.HTM#$114">217</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>788
When his visible presence was taken from them, Jesus did not leave his
disciples orphans. He promised to remain with them until the end of time; he
sent them his Spirit.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-115 href="__P28.HTM#$115">218</a></sup></font> As a result communion with Jesus has become,
in a way, more intense: &quot;By communicating his Spirit, Christ mystically
constitutes as his body those brothers of his who are called together from
every nation.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-116 href="__P28.HTM#$116">219</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>789
The comparison of the Church with the body casts light on the intimate bond
between Christ and his Church. Not only is she gathered around him; she is
united in him, in his body. Three aspects of the Church as the Body of Christ
are to be more specifically noted: the unity of all her members with each other
as a result of their union with Christ; Christ as head of the Body; and the
Church as bride of Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;One
Body&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>790
Believers who respond to God's word and become members of Christ's Body, become
intimately united with him: &quot;In that body the life of Christ is communicated
to those who believe, and who, through the sacraments, are united in a hidden
and real way to Christ in his Passion and glorification.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-117 href="__P28.HTM#$117">220</a></sup></font> This
is especially true of Baptism, which unites us to Christ's death and
Resurrection, and the Eucharist, by which &quot;really sharing in the body of
the Lord, . . . we are taken up into communion with him and with one
another.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-118 href="__P28.HTM#$118">221</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>791
The body's unity does not do away with the diversity of its members: &quot;In
the building up of Christ's Body there is engaged a diversity of members and
functions. There is only one Spirit who, according to his own richness and the
needs of the ministries, gives his different gifts for the welfare of the
Church.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-119 href="__P28.HTM#$119">222</a></sup></font> The unity of the Mystical Body produces and stimulates
charity among the faithful: &quot;From this it follows that if one member
suffers anything, all the members suffer with him, and if one member is
honored, all the members together rejoice.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-11A href="__P28.HTM#$11A">223</a></sup></font> Finally, the unity
of the Mystical Body triumphs over all human divisions: &quot;For as many of
you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor
Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for
you are all one in Christ Jesus.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-11B href="__P28.HTM#$11B">224</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Christ
is the Head of this Body&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>792
Christ &quot;is the head of the body, the Church.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-11C href="__P28.HTM#$11C">225</a></sup></font> He is the
principle of creation and redemption. Raised to the Father's glory, &quot;in
everything he (is) preeminent,&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-11D href="__P28.HTM#$11D">226</a></sup></font> especially in the Church,
through whom he extends his reign over all things.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>793
Christ unites us with his Passover: all his members must strive to resemble
him, &quot;until Christ be formed&quot; in them.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-11E href="__P28.HTM#$11E">227</a></sup></font> &quot;For this
reason we . . . are taken up into the mysteries of his life, . . . associated
with his sufferings as the body with its head, suffering with him, that with
him we may be glorified.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-11F href="__P28.HTM#$11F">228</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>794
Christ provides for our growth: to make us grow toward him, our
head,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-11G href="__P28.HTM#$11G">229</a></sup></font> he provides in his Body, the Church, the gifts and assistance
by which we help one another along the way of salvation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>795
Christ and his Church thus together make up the &quot;whole Christ&quot;
(Christus totus). the Church is one with Christ. the saints are acutely aware
of this unity:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>Let us rejoice then and give
thanks that we have become not only Christians, but Christ himself. Do you
understand and grasp, brethren, God's grace toward us? Marvel and rejoice: we
have become Christ. For if he is the head, we are the members; he and we
together are the whole man.... the fullness of Christ then is the head and the
members. But what does &quot;head and members&quot; mean? Christ and the
Church.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-11H href="__P28.HTM#$11H">230</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>Our redeemer has shown himself
to be one person with the holy Church whom he has taken to himself.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-11I href="__P28.HTM#$11I">231</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>Head and members form as it
were one and the same mystical person.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-11J href="__P28.HTM#$11J">232</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>A reply of St. Joan of Arc to
her judges sums up the faith of the holy doctors and the good sense of the
believer: &quot;About Jesus Christ and the Church, I simply know they're just
one thing, and we shouldn't complicate the matter.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-11K href="__P28.HTM#$11K">233</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Church
is the Bride of Christ</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>796
The unity of Christ and the Church, head and members of one Body, also implies
the distinction of the two within a personal relationship. This aspect is often
expressed by the image of bridegroom and bride. the theme of Christ as
Bridegroom of the Church was prepared for by the prophets and announced by John
the Baptist.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-11L href="__P28.HTM#$11L">234</a></sup></font> The Lord referred to himself as the
&quot;bridegroom.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-11M href="__P28.HTM#$11M">235</a></sup></font> The Apostle speaks of the whole Church and
of each of the faithful, members of his Body, as a bride &quot;betrothed&quot;
to Christ the Lord so as to become but one spirit with him.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-11N href="__P28.HTM#$11N">236</a></sup></font> The
Church is the spotless bride of the spotless Lamb.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-11O href="__P28.HTM#$11O">237</a></sup></font> &quot;Christ
loved the Church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify
her.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-11P href="__P28.HTM#$11P">238</a></sup></font> He has joined her with himself in an everlasting covenant
and never stops caring for her as for his own body:<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-11Q href="__P28.HTM#$11Q">239</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>This is the whole Christ, head
and body, one formed from many . . . whether the head or members speak, it is
Christ who speaks. He speaks in his role as the head (ex persona capitis) and
in his role as body (ex persona corporis). What does this mean? &quot;The two
will become one flesh. This is a great mystery, and I am applying it to Christ
and the Church.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-11R href="__P28.HTM#$11R">240</a></sup></font> and the Lord himself says in the Gospel:
&quot;So they are no longer two, but one flesh.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-11S href="__P28.HTM#$11S">241</a></sup></font> They are, in
fact, two different persons, yet they are one in the conjugal union, . . . as
head, he calls himself the bridegroom, as body, he calls himself
&quot;bride.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-11T href="__P28.HTM#$11T">242</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>III. THE
CHURCH IS THE TEMPLE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>797
&quot;What the soul is to the human body, the Holy Spirit is to the Body of
Christ, which is the Church.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-11U href="__P28.HTM#$11U">243</a></sup></font> &quot;To this Spirit of Christ,
as an invisible principle, is to be ascribed the fact that all the parts of the
body are joined one with the other and with their exalted head; for the whole
Spirit of Christ is in the head, the whole Spirit is in the body, and the whole
Spirit is in each of the members.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-11V href="__P28.HTM#$11V">244</a></sup></font> The Holy Spirit makes the
Church &quot;the temple of the living God&quot;:<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-11W href="__P28.HTM#$11W">245</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>Indeed, it is to the Church
herself that the &quot;Gift of God&quot; has been entrusted.... In it is in her
that communion with Christ has been deposited, that is to say: the Holy Spirit,
the pledge of incorruptibility, the strengthening of our faith and the ladder
of our ascent to God.... For where the Church is, there also is God's Spirit;
where God's Spirit is, there is the Church and every grace.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-11X href="__P28.HTM#$11X">246</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>798
The Holy Spirit is &quot;the principle of every vital and truly saving action
in each part of the Body.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-11Y href="__P28.HTM#$11Y">247</a></sup></font> He works in many ways to build up
the whole Body in charity:<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-11Z href="__P28.HTM#$11Z">248</a></sup></font> by God's Word &quot;which is able to
build you up&quot;;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-120 href="__P28.HTM#$120">249</a></sup></font> by Baptism, through which he forms Christ's
Body;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-121 href="__P28.HTM#$121">250</a></sup></font> by the sacraments, which give growth and healing to Christ's
members; by &quot;the grace of the apostles, which holds first place among his
gifts&quot;;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-122 href="__P28.HTM#$122">251</a></sup></font> by the virtues, which make us act according to what is
good; finally, by the many special graces (called &quot;charisms&quot;), by
which he makes the faithful &quot;fit and ready to undertake various tasks and
offices for the renewal and building up of the Church.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-123 href="__P28.HTM#$123">252</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Charisms</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>799
Whether extraordinary or simple and humble, charisms are graces of the Holy
Spirit which directly or indirectly benefit the Church, ordered as they are to
her building up, to the good of men, and to the needs of the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>800
Charisms are to be accepted with gratitude by the person who receives them and
by all members of the Church as well. They are a wonderfully rich grace for the
apostolic vitality and for the holiness of the entire Body of Christ, provided
they really are genuine gifts of the Holy Spirit and are used in full
conformity with authentic promptings of this same Spirit, that is, in keeping
with charity, the true measure of all charisms.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-124 href="__P28.HTM#$124">253</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>801
It is in this sense that discernment of charisms is always necessary. No
charism is exempt from being referred and submitted to the Church's shepherds.
&quot;Their office (is) not indeed to extinguish the Spirit, but to test all
things and hold fast to what is good,&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-125 href="__P28.HTM#$125">254</a></sup></font> so that all the diverse
and complementary charisms work together &quot;for the common
good.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-126 href="__P28.HTM#$126">255</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>IN BRIEF</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>802 Christ Jesus &quot;gave
himself for us to redeem us from all iniquity and to purify for himself a
people of his own&quot; (Titus 2:14).</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>803 &quot;You are a chosen
race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's own people&quot;
(1 Pet 2:9).</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>804 One enters into the
People of God by faith and Baptism. &quot;All men are called to belong to the
new People of God&quot; (LG 13), so that, in Christ, &quot;men may form one
family and one People of God&quot; (AG 1).</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>805 The Church is the Body of
Christ. Through the Spirit and his action in the sacraments, above all the
Eucharist, Christ, who once was dead and is now risen, establishes the
community of believers as his own Body.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>806 In the unity of this
Body, there is a diversity of members and functions. All members are linked to
one another, especially to those who are suffering, to the poor and persecuted.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>807 The Church is this Body
of which Christ is the head: she lives from him, in him, and for him; he lives
with her and in her.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>808 The Church is the Bride
of Christ: he loved her and handed himself over for her. He has purified her by
his blood and made her the fruitful mother of all God's children.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>809 The Church is the Temple
of the Holy Spirit. the Spirit is the soul, as it were, of the Mystical Body,
the source of its life, of its unity in diversity, and of the riches of its
