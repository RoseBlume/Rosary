<p class=MsoNormal>199
&quot;I believe in God&quot;: this first affirmation of the Apostles' Creed is
also the most fundamental. the whole Creed speaks of God, and when it also
speaks of man and of the world it does so in relation to God. the other
articles of the Creed all depend on the first, just as the remaining
Commandments make the first explicit. the other articles help us to know God
better as he revealed himself progressively to men. &quot;The faithful first
profess their belief in God.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-6B href="__P16.HTM#$6B">2</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I. &quot;I
BELIEVE IN ONE GOD&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>200
These are the words with which the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed begins. the
confession of God's oneness, which has its roots in the divine revelation of
the Old Covenant, is inseparable from the profession of God's existence and is
equally fundamental. God is unique; there is only one God: &quot;The Christian
faith confesses that God is one in nature, substance and
essence.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-6C href="__P16.HTM#$6C">3</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>201
To Israel, his chosen, God revealed himself as the only One: &quot;Hear, O
Israel: the LORD our God is one LORD; and you shall love the LORD your God with
all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-6D href="__P16.HTM#$6D">4</a></sup></font>
Through the prophets, God calls Israel and all nations to turn to him, the one
and only God: &quot;Turn to me and be saved, all the ends of the earth! For I
am God, and there is no other.. . To me every knee shall bow, every tongue
shall swear. 'Only in the LORD, it shall be said of me, are righteousness and
strength.'&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-6E href="__P16.HTM#$6E">5</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>202
Jesus himself affirms that God is &quot;the one Lord&quot; whom you must love
&quot;with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and
with all your strength&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-6F href="__P16.HTM#$6F">6</a></sup></font> At the same time Jesus gives us to
understand that he himself is &quot;the Lord&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-6G href="__P16.HTM#$6G">7</a></sup></font> To confess that
Jesus is Lord is distinctive of Christian faith. This is not contrary to belief
in the One God. Nor does believing in the Holy Spirit as &quot;Lord and giver
of life&quot; introduce any division into the One God:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>We firmly believe and confess
without reservation that there is only one true God, eternal infinite (immensus)
and unchangeable, incomprehensible, almighty and ineffable, the Father and the
Son and the Holy Spirit; three persons indeed, but one essence, substance or
nature entirely simple.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>II. GOD
REVEALS HIS NAME</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>203
God revealed himself to his people Israel by making his name known to them. A
name expresses a person's essence and identity and the meaning of this person's
life. God has a name; he is not an anonymous force. To disclose one's name is
to make oneself known to others; in a way it is to hand oneself over by
becoming accessible, capable of being known more intimately and addressed
personally.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>204
God revealed himself progressively and under different names to his people, but
the revelation that proved to be the fundamental one for both the Old and the
New Covenants was the revelation of the divine name to Moses in the theophany
of the burning bush, on the threshold of the Exodus and of the covenant on
Sinai.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The living
God</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>205
God calls Moses from the midst of a bush that burns without being consumed:
&quot;I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and
the God of Jacob.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-6H href="__P16.HTM#$6H">9</a></sup></font> God is the God of the fathers, the One who had
called and guided the patriarchs in their wanderings. He is the faithful and
compassionate God who remembers them and his promises; he comes to free their
descendants from slavery. He is the God who, from beyond space and time, can do
this and wills to do it, the God who will put his almighty power to work for
this plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I Am
who I Am&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>Moses said to God, &quot;If I
come to the people of Israel and say to them, 'The God of your fathers has sent
me to you', and they ask me, 'What is his name?' what shall I say to
them?&quot; God said to Moses, &quot;I AM WHO I AM.&quot; and he said,
&quot;Say this to the people of Israel, 'I AM has sent me to you'. . . this is
my name for ever, and thus I am to be remembered throughout all
generations.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-6I href="__P16.HTM#$6I">10</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>206
In revealing his mysterious name, YHWH (&quot;I AM HE WHO IS&quot;, &quot;I AM WHO
AM&quot; or &quot;I AM WHO I AM&quot;), God says who he is and by what name he
is to be called. This divine name is mysterious just as God is mystery. It is
at once a name revealed and something like the refusal of a name, and hence it
better expresses God as what he is - infinitely above everything that we can
understand or say: he is the &quot;hidden God&quot;, his name is ineffable, and
he is the God who makes himself close to men.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-6J href="__P16.HTM#$6J">11</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>207
By revealing his name God at the same time reveals his faithfulness which is
from everlasting to everlasting, valid for the past (&quot;I am the God of your
father&quot;), as for the future (&quot;I will be with you&quot;).<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-6K href="__P16.HTM#$6K">12</a></sup></font>
God, who reveals his name as &quot;I AM&quot;, reveals himself as the God who
is always there, present to his people in order to save them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>208
Faced with God's fascinating and mysterious presence, man discovers his own
insignificance. Before the burning bush, Moses takes off his sandals and veils
his face in the presence of God's holiness.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-6L href="__P16.HTM#$6L">13</a></sup></font> Before the glory of the
thrice-holy God, Isaiah cries out: &quot;Woe is me! I am lost; for I am a man
of unclean lips.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-6M href="__P16.HTM#$6M">14</a></sup></font> Before the divine signs wrought by Jesus,
Peter exclaims: &quot;Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-6N href="__P16.HTM#$6N">15</a></sup></font>
But because God is holy, he can forgive the man who realizes that he is a
sinner before him: &quot;I will not execute my fierce anger. . . for I am God
and not man, the Holy One in your midst.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-6O href="__P16.HTM#$6O">16</a></sup></font> The apostle John says
likewise: &quot;We shall. . . reassure our hearts before him whenever our
hearts condemn us; for God is greater than our hearts, and he knows
everything.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-6P href="__P16.HTM#$6P">17</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>209
Out of
respect for the holiness of God, the people of Israel do not pronounce his
name. In the reading of Sacred Scripture, the revealed name (YHWH) is replaced
by the divine title &quot;LORD&quot; (in Hebrew Adonai, in Greek Kyrios). It is
under this title that the divinity of Jesus will be acclaimed: &quot;Jesus is
LORD.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;A God
merciful and gracious&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>210
After Israel's sin, when the people had turned away from God to worship the
golden calf, God hears Moses' prayer of intercession and agrees to walk in the
midst of an unfaithful people, thus demonstrating his love.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-6Q href="__P16.HTM#$6Q">18</a></sup></font> When
Moses asks to see his glory, God responds &quot;I will make all my goodness
pass before you, and will proclaim before you my name &quot;the LORD&quot;
[YHWH].&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-6R href="__P16.HTM#$6R">19</a></sup></font> Then the LORD passes before Moses and proclaims,
&quot;YHWH,<br>
YHWH, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast
love and faithfulness&quot;; Moses then confesses that the LORD is a forgiving
God.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-6S href="__P16.HTM#$6S">20</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>211
The divine name, &quot;I Am&quot; or &quot;He Is&quot;, expresses God's
faithfulness: despite the faithlessness of men's sin and the punishment it
deserves, he keeps &quot;steadfast love for thousands&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-6T href="__P16.HTM#$6T">21</a></sup></font> By going
so far as to give up his own Son for us, God reveals that he is &quot;rich in
mercy&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-6U href="__P16.HTM#$6U">22</a></sup></font> By giving his life to free us from sin, Jesus reveals
that he himself bears the divine name: &quot;When you have lifted up the Son of
man, then you will realize that &quot;I AM&quot;.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-6V href="__P16.HTM#$6V">23</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>God alone
IS</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>212
Over the centuries, Israel's faith was able to manifest and deepen realization
of the riches contained in the revelation of the divine name. God is unique;
there are no other gods besides him.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-6W href="__P16.HTM#$6W">24</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He
transcends the world and history. He made heaven and earth: &quot;They will
perish, but you endure; they will all wear out like a garment....but you are
the same, and your years have no end.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-6X href="__P16.HTM#$6X">25</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In God
&quot;there is no variation or shadow due to change.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-6Y href="__P16.HTM#$6Y">26</a></sup></font> God is
&quot;HE WHO IS&quot;, from everlasting to everlasting, and as such remains
ever faithful to himself and to his promises.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>213
The revelation of the ineffable name &quot;I AM WHO AM&quot; contains then the
truth that God alone IS. the Greek Septuagint translation of the Hebrew
Scriptures, and following it the Church's Tradition, understood the divine name
in this sense: God is the fullness of Being and of every perfection, without
origin and without end. All creatures receive all that they are and have from
him; but he alone is his very being, and he is of himself everything that he
is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>III. GOD,
&quot;HE WHO IS&quot;, IS TRUTH AND LOVE</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>214
God, &quot;HE WHO IS&quot;, revealed himself to Israel as the one &quot;abounding
in steadfast love and faithfulness&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-6Z href="__P16.HTM#$6Z">27</a></sup></font> These two terms express
summarily the riches of the divine name. In all his works God displays, not
only his kindness, goodness, grace and steadfast love, but also his
trustworthiness, constancy, faithfulness and truth. &quot;I give thanks to your
name for your steadfast love and your faithfulness.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-70 href="__P16.HTM#$70">28</a></sup></font> He is the
Truth, for &quot;God is light and in him there is no darkness&quot;; &quot;God
is love&quot;, as the apostle John teaches.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-71 href="__P16.HTM#$71">29</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>God is
Truth</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>215
&quot;The sum of your word is truth; and every one of your righteous ordinances
endures forever.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-72 href="__P16.HTM#$72">30</a></sup></font> &quot;and now, O LORD God, you are God, and
your words are true&quot;;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-73 href="__P16.HTM#$73">31</a></sup></font> this is why God's promises always come
true.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-74 href="__P16.HTM#$74">32</a></sup></font> God is Truth itself, whose words cannot deceive. This is why
one can abandon oneself in full trust to the truth and faithfulness of his word
in all things. the beginning of sin and of man's fall was due to a lie of the
tempter who induced doubt of God's word, kindness and faithfulness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>216
God's truth is his wisdom, which commands the whole created order and governs
the world.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-75 href="__P16.HTM#$75">33</a></sup></font> God, who alone made heaven and earth, can alone impart
true knowledge of every created thing in relation to himself.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-76 href="__P16.HTM#$76">34</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>217
God is also truthful when he reveals himself - the teaching that comes from God
is &quot;true instruction&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-77 href="__P16.HTM#$77">35</a></sup></font> When he sends his Son into the world
it will be &quot;to bear witness to the truth&quot;:<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-78 href="__P16.HTM#$78">36</a></sup></font> &quot;We know
that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, to know him who is
true.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-79 href="__P16.HTM#$79">37</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>God is Love</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>218
In the course of its history, Israel was able to discover that God had only one
reason to reveal himself to them, a single motive for choosing them from among
all peoples as his special possession: his sheer gratuitous love.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-7A href="__P16.HTM#$7A">38</a></sup></font> and
thanks to the prophets Israel understood that it was again out of love that God
never stopped saving them and pardoning their unfaithfulness and
sins.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-7B href="__P16.HTM#$7B">39</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>219
God's love for Israel is compared to a father's love for his son. His love for
his people is stronger than a mother's for her children. God loves his people
more than a bridegroom his beloved; his love will be victorious over even the
worst infidelities and will extend to his most precious gift: &quot;God so
loved the world that he gave his only Son.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-7C href="__P16.HTM#$7C">40</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>220
God's love is &quot;everlasting&quot;:<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-7D href="__P16.HTM#$7D">41</a></sup></font> &quot;For the mountains may
depart and the hills be removed, but my steadfast love shall not depart from
you.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-7E href="__P16.HTM#$7E">42</a></sup></font> Through Jeremiah, God declares to his people, &quot;I have
loved you with an everlasting love; therefore I have continued my faithfulness
to you.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-7F href="__P16.HTM#$7F">43</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>221
But St. John goes even further when he affirms that &quot;God is
love&quot;:<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-7G href="__P16.HTM#$7G">44</a></sup></font> God's very being is love. By sending his only Son and the
Spirit of Love in the fullness of time, God has revealed his innermost
secret:<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-7H href="__P16.HTM#$7H">45</a></sup></font> God himself is an eternal exchange of love, Father, Son and
Holy Spirit, and he has destined us to share in that exchange.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>IV. THE IMPLICATIONS OF FAITH IN ONE GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>222
Believing in God, the only One, and loving him with all our being has enormous
consequences for our whole life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>223
It means coming to know God's greatness and majesty: &quot;Behold, God is
great, and we know him not.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-7I href="__P16.HTM#$7I">46</a></sup></font> Therefore, we must &quot;serve God
first&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-7J href="__P16.HTM#$7J">47</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>224
It means living in thanksgiving: if God is the only One, everything we are and
have comes from him: &quot;What have you that you did not
receive?&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-7K href="__P16.HTM#$7K">48</a></sup></font> &quot;What shall I render to the LORD for all his
bounty to me?&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-7L href="__P16.HTM#$7L">49</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>225
It means knowing the unity and true dignity of all men: everyone is made in the
image and likeness of God.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-7M href="__P16.HTM#$7M">50</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>226
It means making good use of created things: faith in God, the only One, leads
us to use everything that is not God only insofar as it brings us closer to
him, and to detach ourselves from it insofar as it turns us away from him: <br>
My Lord and my God, take from me everything that distances me from you. <br>
My Lord and my God, give me everything that brings me closer to you <br>
My Lord and my God, detach me from myself to give my all to you.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-7N href="__P16.HTM#$7N">51</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>227
It means trusting God in every circumstance, even in adversity. A prayer of St.
Teresa of Jesus wonderfully expresses this trust:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let nothing
trouble you / Let nothing frighten you Everything passes / God never changes
Patience / Obtains all Whoever has God / Wants for nothing God alone is
enough.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-7O href="__P16.HTM#$7O">52</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>IN BRIEF</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>228 &quot;Hear, O Israel, the
LORD our God is one LORD...&quot; (Dt 6:4;
Mk 12:29). &quot;The supreme being must be
unique, without equal. . . If God is not one, he is not God&quot; (Tertullian,
Adv. Marc., 1, 3, 5: PL 2, 274).</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>229 Faith in God leads us to
turn to him alone as our first origin and our ultimate goal, and neither to
prefer anything to him nor to substitute anything for him.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>230 Even when he reveals
himself, God remains a mystery beyond words: &quot;If you understood him, it
would not be God&quot; (St. Augustine, Sermo 52, 6, 16: PL 38, 360 and Sermo
117, 3, 5: PL 38, 663).</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>231 The God of our faith has
revealed himself as HE WHO IS; and he has made himself known as &quot;abounding
in steadfast love and faithfulness&quot; (Ex
34:6). God's very being is Truth and Love.</i></p>
