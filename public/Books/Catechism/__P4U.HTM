<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>III. The Three Degrees of the Sacrament of Holy
Orders</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1554
&quot;The divinely instituted ecclesiastical ministry is exercised in different
degrees by those who even from ancient times have been called bishops, priests,
and deacons.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1ST href="__P4U.HTM#$1ST">32</a></sup></font> Catholic doctrine, expressed in the liturgy, the
Magisterium, and the constant practice of the Church, recognizes that there are
two degrees of ministerial participation in the priesthood of Christ: the
episcopacy and the presbyterate . the diaconate is intended to help and serve
them. For this reason the term sacerdos in current usage denotes bishops and
priests but not deacons. Yet Catholic doctrine teaches that the degrees of
priestly participation (episcopate and presbyterate) and the degree of service
(diaconate) are all three conferred by a sacramental act called
&quot;ordination,&quot; that is, by the sacrament of Holy Orders:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>Let everyone revere the
deacons as Jesus Christ, the bishop as the image of the Father, and the
presbyters as the senate of God and the assembly of the apostles. For without
them one cannot speak of the Church.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1SU href="__P4U.HTM#$1SU">33</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Episcopal
ordination - fullness of the sacrament of Holy Orders</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1555
&quot;Amongst those various offices which have been exercised in the Church
from the earliest times the chief place, according to the witness of tradition,
is held by the function of those who, through their appointment to the dignity
and responsibility of bishop, and in virtue consequently of the unbroken
succession going back to the beginning, are regarded as transmitters of the
apostolic line.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1SV href="__P4U.HTM#$1SV">34</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1556
To fulfil their exalted mission, &quot;the apostles were endowed by Christ with
a special outpouring of the Holy Spirit coming upon them, and by the imposition
of hands they passed on to their auxiliaries the gift of the Spirit, which is
transmitted down to our day through episcopal consecration.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1SW href="__P4U.HTM#$1SW">35</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1557
The Second Vatican Council &quot;teaches . . . that the fullness of the
sacrament of Holy Orders is conferred by episcopal consecration, that fullness
namely which, both in the liturgical tradition of the Church and the language
of the Fathers of the Church, is called the high priesthood, the acme (summa)
of the sacred ministry.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1SX href="__P4U.HTM#$1SX">36</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1558
&quot;Episcopal consecration confers, together with the office of sanctifying,
also the offices of teaching and ruling.... In fact ... by the imposition of
hands and through the words of the consecration, the grace of the Holy Spirit
is given, and a sacred character is impressed in such wise that bishops, in an
eminent and visible manner, take the place of Christ himself, teacher,
shepherd, and priest, and act as his representative (in Eius persona
agant).&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1SY href="__P4U.HTM#$1SY">37</a></sup></font> &quot;By virtue, therefore, of the Holy Spirit who has
been given to them, bishops have been constituted true and authentic teachers
of the faith and have been made pontiffs and pastors.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1SZ href="__P4U.HTM#$1SZ">38</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1559
&quot;One is constituted a member of the episcopal body in virtue of the
sacramental consecration and by the hierarchical communion with the head and
members of the college.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1T0 href="__P4U.HTM#$1T0">39</a></sup></font> The character and collegial nature of
the episcopal order are evidenced among other ways by the Church's ancient
practice which calls for several bishops to participate in the consecration of
a new bishop.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1T1 href="__P4U.HTM#$1T1">40</a></sup></font> In our day, the lawful ordination of a bishop requires
a special intervention of the Bishop of Rome, because he is the supreme visible
bond of the communion of the particular Churches in the one Church and the guarantor
of their freedom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1560
As Christ's vicar, each bishop has the pastoral care of the particular Church
entrusted to him, but at the same time he bears collegially with all his
brothers in the episcopacy the solicitude for all the Churches: &quot;Though
each bishop is the lawful pastor only of the portion of the flock entrusted to
his care, as a legitimate successor of the apostles he is, by divine
institution and precept, responsible with the other bishops for the apostolic
mission of the Church.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1T2 href="__P4U.HTM#$1T2">41</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1561
The above considerations explain why the Eucharist celebrated by the bishop has
a quite special significance as an expression of the Church gathered around the
altar, with the one who represents Christ, the Good Shepherd and Head of his
Church, presiding.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1T3 href="__P4U.HTM#$1T3">42</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The
ordination of priests - co-workers of the bishops</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1562
&quot;Christ, whom the Father hallowed and sent into the world, has, through
his apostles, made their successors, the bishops namely, sharers in his
consecration and mission; and these, in their turn, duly entrusted in varying
degrees various members of the Church with the office of their
ministry.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1T4 href="__P4U.HTM#$1T4">43</a></sup></font> &quot;The function of the bishops' ministry was
handed over in a subordinate degree to priests so that they might be appointed
in the order of the priesthood and be co-workers of the episcapal order for the
proper fulfillment of the apostolic mission that had been entrusted to it by
Christ.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1T5 href="__P4U.HTM#$1T5">44</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1563
&quot;Because it is joined with the episcopal order the office of priests
shares in the authority by which Christ himself builds up and sanctifies and
rules his Body. Hence the priesthood of priests, while presupposing the
sacraments of initiation, is nevertheless conferred by its own particular
sacrament. Through that sacrament priests by the anointing of the Holy Spirit
are signed with a special character and so are configured to Christ the priest
in such a way that they are able to act in the person of Christ the head.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1T6 href="__P4U.HTM#$1T6">45</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1564
&quot;Whilst not having the supreme degree of the pontifical office, and
notwithstanding the fact that they depend on the bishops in the exercise of
their own proper power, the priests are for all that associated with them by
reason of their sacerdotal dignity; and in virtue of the sacrament of Holy
Orders, after the image of Christ, the supreme and eternal priest, they are
consecrated in order to preach the Gospel and shepherd the faithful as well as
to celebrate divine worship as true priests of the New
Testament.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1T7 href="__P4U.HTM#$1T7">46</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1565
Through the sacrament of Holy Orders priests share in the universal dimensions
of the mission that Christ entrusted to the apostles. the spiritual gift they
have received in ordination prepares them, not for a limited and restricted
mission, &quot;but for the fullest, in fact the universal mission of salvation
'to the end of the earth,&quot;'<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1T8 href="__P4U.HTM#$1T8">47</a></sup></font> &quot;prepared in spirit to preach
the Gospel everywhere.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1T9 href="__P4U.HTM#$1T9">48</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1566
&quot;It is in the Eucharistic cult or in the Eucharistic assembly of the
faithful (synaxis) that they exercise in a supreme degree their sacred office;
there, acting in the person of Christ and proclaiming his mystery, they unite
the votive offerings of the faithful to the sacrifice of Christ their head, and
in the sacrifice of the Mass they make present again and apply, until the
coming of the Lord, the unique sacrifice of the New Testament, that namely of
Christ offering himself once for all a spotless victim to the
Father.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1TA href="__P4U.HTM#$1TA">49</a></sup></font> From this unique sacrifice their whole priestly
ministry draws its strength.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1TB href="__P4U.HTM#$1TB">50</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1567
&quot;The priests, prudent cooperators of the episcopal college and its support
and instrument, called to the service of the People of God, constitute,
together with their bishop, a unique sacerdotal college (presbyterium)
dedicated, it is, true to a variety of distinct duties. In each local assembly
of the faithful they represent, in a certain sense, the bishop, with whom they
are associated in all trust and generosity; in part they take upon themselves
his duties and solicitude and in their daily toils discharge
them.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1TC href="__P4U.HTM#$1TC">51</a></sup></font> priests can exercise their ministry only in dependence on
the bishop and in communion with him. the promise of obedience they make to the
bishop at the moment of ordination and the kiss of peace from him at the end of
the ordination liturgy mean that the bishop considers them his co-workers, his
sons, his brothers and his friends, and that they in return owe him love and
obedience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1568
&quot;All priests, who are constituted in the order of priesthood by the
sacrament of Order, are bound together by an intimate sacramental brotherhood,
but in a special way they form one priestly body in the diocese to which they
are attached under their own bishop. . ;&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1TD href="__P4U.HTM#$1TD">52</a></sup></font> The unity of the
presbyterium finds liturgical expression in the custom of the presbyters'
imposing hands, after the bishop, during the Ate of ordination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The
ordination of deacons - &quot;in order to serve&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1569
&quot;At a lower level of the hierarchy are to be found deacons, who receive
the imposition of hands 'not unto the priesthood, but unto the
ministry.&quot;'<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1TE href="__P4U.HTM#$1TE">53</a></sup></font> At an ordination to the diaconate only the bishop
lays hands on the candidate, thus signifying the deacon's special attachment to
the bishop in the tasks of his &quot;diakonia.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1TF href="__P4U.HTM#$1TF">54</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1570
Deacons share in Christ's mission and grace in a special way.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1TG href="__P4U.HTM#$1TG">55</a></sup></font> The
sacrament of Holy Orders marks them with an imprint (&ldquo;character&quot;) which
cannot be removed and which configures them to Christ, who made himself the
&quot;deacon&quot; or servant of all.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1TH href="__P4U.HTM#$1TH">56</a></sup></font> Among other tasks, it is the
task of deacons to assist the bishop and priests in the celebration of the divine
mysteries, above all the Eucharist, in the distribution of Holy Communion, in
assisting at and blessing marriages, in the proclamation of the Gospel and
preaching, in presiding over funerals, and in dedicating themselves to the
various ministries of charity.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1TI href="__P4U.HTM#$1TI">57</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1571
Since the Second Vatican Council the Latin Church has restored the diaconate
&quot;as a proper and permanent rank of the hierarchy,&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1TJ href="__P4U.HTM#$1TJ">58</a></sup></font> while the
Churches of the East had always maintained it. This permanent diaconate, which
can be conferred on married men, constitutes an important enrichment for the
Church's mission. Indeed it is appropriate and useful that men who carry out a
truly diaconal ministry in the Church, whether in its liturgical and pastoral
life or whether in its social and charitable works, should &quot;be
strengthened by the imposition of hands which has come down from the apostles.
They would be more closely bound to the altar and their ministry would be made
more fruitful through the sacramental grace of the diaconate.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1TK href="__P4U.HTM#$1TK">59</a></sup></font></p>
