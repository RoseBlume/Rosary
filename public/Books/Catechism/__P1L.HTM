<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Paragraph 3. THE MYSTERIES OF CHRIST'S LIFE</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>512
Concerning Christ's life the Creed speaks only about the mysteries of the
Incarnation (conception and birth) and Paschal mystery (passion, crucifixion,
death, burial, descent into hell, resurrection and ascension). It says nothing
explicitly about the mysteries of Jesus' hidden or public life, but the
articles of faith concerning his Incarnation and Passover do shed light on the
whole of his earthly life. &quot;All that Jesus did and taught, from the beginning
until the day when he was taken up to heaven&quot;,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-JJ href="__P1L.HTM#$JJ">171</a></sup></font> is to be seen in
the light of the mysteries of Christmas and Easter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>513
According to circumstances catechesis will make use of all the richness of the
mysteries of Jesus. Here it is enough merely to indicate some elements common
to all the mysteries of Christ's life (I), in order then to sketch the
principal mysteries of Jesus' hidden (II) and public (III) life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I. CHRIST'S
WHOLE LIFE IS MYSTERY</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>514
Many things about Jesus of interest to human curiosity do not figure in the
Gospels. Almost nothing is said about his hidden life at Nazareth, and even a
great part of his public life is not recounted.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-JK href="__P1L.HTM#$JK">172</a></sup></font> What is written in
the Gospels was set down there &quot;so that you may believe that Jesus is the
Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his
name.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-JL href="__P1L.HTM#$JL">173</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>515
The Gospels were written by men who were among the first to have the
faith<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-JM href="__P1L.HTM#$JM">174</a></sup></font> and wanted to share it with others. Having known in faith who
Jesus is, they could see and make others see the traces of his mystery in all
his earthly life. From the swaddling clothes of his birth to the vinegar of his
Passion and the shroud of his Resurrection, everything in Jesus' life was a
sign of his mystery.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-JN href="__P1L.HTM#$JN">175</a></sup></font> His deeds, miracles and words all revealed that
&quot;in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-JO href="__P1L.HTM#$JO">176</a></sup></font> His
humanity appeared as &quot;sacrament&quot;, that is, the sign and instrument,
of his divinity and of the salvation he brings: what was visible in his earthly
life leads to the invisible mystery of his divine sonship and redemptive
mission</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Characteristics
common to Jesus' mysteries</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>516
Christ's whole earthly life - his words and deeds, his silences and sufferings,
indeed his manner of being and speaking - is Revelation of the Father. Jesus
can say: &quot;Whoever has seen me has seen the Father&quot;, and the Father
can say: &quot;This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-JP href="__P1L.HTM#$JP">177</a></sup></font> Because
our Lord became man in order to do his Father's will, even the least
characteristics of his mysteries manifest &quot;God's love. . . among
us&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-JQ href="__P1L.HTM#$JQ">178</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>517
Christ's whole life is a mystery of redemption. Redemption comes to us above
all through the blood of his cross,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-JR href="__P1L.HTM#$JR">179</a></sup></font> but this mystery is at work
throughout Christ's entire life: -already in his Incarnation through which by
becoming poor he enriches us with his poverty;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-JS href="__P1L.HTM#$JS">180</a></sup></font> - in his hidden life
which by his submission atones for our disobedience;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-JT href="__P1L.HTM#$JT">181</a></sup></font> - in his word
which purifies its hearers;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-JU href="__P1L.HTM#$JU">182</a></sup></font>- in his healings and exorcisms by which
&quot;he took our infirmities and bore our diseases&quot;;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-JV href="__P1L.HTM#$JV">183</a></sup></font> - and in
his Resurrection by which he justifies us.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-JW href="__P1L.HTM#$JW">184</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>518
Christ's whole life is a mystery of recapitulation. All Jesus did, said and
suffered had for its aim restoring fallen man to his original vocation:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When Christ became incarnate and was made man, he recapitulated in
himself the long history of mankind and procured for us a &quot;short cut&quot;
to salvation, so that what we had lost in Adam, that is, being in the image and
likeness of God, we might recover in Christ Jesus.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-JX href="__P1L.HTM#$JX">185</a></sup></font> For this reason
Christ experienced all the stages of life, thereby giving communion with God to
all men.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-JY href="__P1L.HTM#$JY">186</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our
communion in the mysteries of Jesus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>519
All Christ's riches &quot;are for every individual and are everybody's
property.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-JZ href="__P1L.HTM#$JZ">187</a></sup></font> Christ did not live his life for himself but for us,
from his Incarnation &quot;for us men and for our salvation&quot; to his death
&quot;for our sins&quot; and Resurrection &quot;for our
justification&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-K0 href="__P1L.HTM#$K0">188</a></sup></font> He is still &quot;our advocate with the
Father&quot;, who &quot;always lives to make intercession&quot; for us.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-K1 href="__P1L.HTM#$K1">189</a></sup></font>
He remains ever &quot;in the presence of God on our behalf, bringing before him
all that he lived and suffered for us.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-K2 href="__P1L.HTM#$K2">190</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>520
In all of his life Jesus presents himself as our model. He is &quot;the perfect
man&quot;,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-K3 href="__P1L.HTM#$K3">191</a></sup></font> who invites us to become his disciples and follow him. In
humbling himself, he has given us an example to imitate, through his prayer he
draws us to pray, and by his poverty he calls us to accept freely the privation
and persecutions that may come our way.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-K4 href="__P1L.HTM#$K4">192</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>521
Christ enables us to live in him all that he himself lived, and he lives it in
us. &quot;By his Incarnation, he, the Son of God, has in a certain way united
himself with each man.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-K5 href="__P1L.HTM#$K5">193</a></sup></font> We are called only to become one with
him, for he enables us as the members of his Body to share in what he lived for
us in his flesh as our model:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>We must continue to accomplish
in ourselves the stages of Jesus' life and his mysteries and often to beg him
to perfect and realize them in us and in his whole Church. . . For it is the
plan of the Son of God to make us and the whole Church partake in his mysteries
and to extend them to and continue them in us and in his whole Church. This is
his plan for fulfilling his mysteries in us.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-K6 href="__P1L.HTM#$K6">194</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>II. THE
MYSTERIES OF JESUS' INFANCY AND HIDDEN LIFE</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The
preparations</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>522
The coming of God's Son to earth is an event of such immensity that God willed
to prepare for it over centuries. He makes everything converge on Christ: all
the rituals and sacrifices, figures and symbols of the &quot;First
Covenant&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-K7 href="__P1L.HTM#$K7">195</a></sup></font> He announces him through the mouths of the prophets
who succeeded one another in Israel. Moreover, he awakens in the hearts of the
pagans a dim expectation of this coming.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>523
St. John the Baptist is the Lord's immediate precursor or forerunner, sent to
prepare his way.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-K8 href="__P1L.HTM#$K8">196</a></sup></font> &quot;Prophet of the Most High&quot;, John
surpasses all the prophets, of whom he is the last.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-K9 href="__P1L.HTM#$K9">197</a></sup></font> He inaugurates
the Gospel, already from his mother's womb welcomes the coming of Christ, and
rejoices in being &quot;the friend of the bridegroom&quot;, whom he points out
as &quot;the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-KA href="__P1L.HTM#$KA">198</a></sup></font>
Going before Jesus &quot;in the spirit and power of Elijah&quot;, John bears
witness to Christ in his preaching, by his Baptism of conversion, and through
his martyrdom.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-KB href="__P1L.HTM#$KB">199</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>524
When the Church celebrates the liturgy of Advent each year, she makes present
this ancient expectancy of the Messiah, for by sharing in the long preparation
for the Saviour's first coming, the faithful renew their ardent desire for his
second coming.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-KC href="__P1L.HTM#$KC">200</a></sup></font> By celebrating the precursor's birth and martyrdom,
the Church unites herself to his desire: &quot;He must increase, but I must
decrease.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-KD href="__P1L.HTM#$KD">201</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The
Christmas mystery</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>525
Jesus was born in a humble stable, into a poor family.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-KE href="__P1L.HTM#$KE">202</a></sup></font> Simple
shepherds were the first witnesses to this event. In this poverty heaven's
glory was made manifest.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-KF href="__P1L.HTM#$KF">203</a></sup></font> The Church never tires of singing the glory
of this night:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>The Virgin today brings into
the world the Eternal</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>and the earth offers a cave to
the Inaccessible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>The angels and shepherds
praise him</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>and the magi advance with the
star,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>For you are born for us,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>Little Child, God
eternal!<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-KG href="__P1L.HTM#$KG">204</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>526
To become a child in relation to God is the condition for entering the
kingdom.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-KH href="__P1L.HTM#$KH">205</a></sup></font> For this, we must humble ourselves and become little. Even
more: to become &quot;children of God&quot; we must be &quot;born from
above&quot; or &quot;born of God&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-KI href="__P1L.HTM#$KI">206</a></sup></font> Only when Christ is formed
in us will the mystery of Christmas be fulfilled in us.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-KJ href="__P1L.HTM#$KJ">207</a></sup></font> Christmas is
the mystery of this &quot;marvellous exchange&quot;:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>O marvellous exchange! Man's Creator has become man,
born of the Virgin. We have been made sharers in the divinity of Christ who
humbled himself to share our humanity.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-KK href="__P1L.HTM#$KK">208</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The
mysteries of Jesus' infancy</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>527
Jesus' circumcision, on the eighth day after his birth,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-KL href="__P1L.HTM#$KL">209</a></sup></font> is the sign
of his incorporation into Abraham's descendants, into the people of the
covenant. It is the sign of his submission to the Law<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-KM href="__P1L.HTM#$KM">210</a></sup></font> and his
deputation to Israel's worship, in which he will participate throughout his
life. This sign prefigures that &quot;circumcision of Christ&quot; which is
Baptism.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-KN href="__P1L.HTM#$KN">211</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>528
The Epiphany is the manifestation of Jesus as Messiah of Israel, Son of God and
Saviour of the world. the great feast of Epiphany celebrates the adoration of
Jesus by the wise men (magi) from the East, together with his baptism in the
Jordan and the wedding feast at Cana in Galilee.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-KO href="__P1L.HTM#$KO">212</a></sup></font> In the magi,
representatives of the neighbouring pagan religions, the Gospel sees the
first-fruits of the nations, who welcome the good news of salvation through the
Incarnation. the magi's coming to Jerusalem in order to pay homage to the king
of the Jews shows that they seek in Israel, in the messianic light of the star
of David, the one who will be king of the nations.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-KP href="__P1L.HTM#$KP">213</a></sup></font> Their coming
means that pagans can discover Jesus and worship him as Son of God and Saviour
of the world only by turning towards the Jews and receiving from them the
messianic promise as contained in the Old Testament.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-KQ href="__P1L.HTM#$KQ">214</a></sup></font> The Epiphany
shows that &quot;the full number of the nations&quot; now takes its &quot;place
in the family of the patriarchs&quot;, and acquires Israelitica
dignitas<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-KR href="__P1L.HTM#$KR">215</a></sup></font> (is made &quot;worthy of the heritage of Israel&quot;).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>529
The presentation of Jesus in the temple shows him to be the firstborn Son who
belongs to the Lord.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-KS href="__P1L.HTM#$KS">216</a></sup></font> With Simeon and Anna, all Israel awaits its
encounter with the Saviour - the name given to this event in the Byzantine
tradition. Jesus is recognized as the long-expected Messiah, the &quot;light to
the nations&quot; and the &quot;glory of Israel&quot;, but also &quot;a sign
that is spoken against&quot;. the sword of sorrow predicted for Mary announces
Christ's perfect and unique oblation on the cross that will impart the
salvation God had &quot;prepared in the presence of all peoples&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>530
The flight into Egypt and the massacre of the innocents<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-KT href="__P1L.HTM#$KT">217</a></sup></font> make
manifest the opposition of darkness to the light: &quot;He came to his own
home, and his own people received him not.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-KU href="__P1L.HTM#$KU">218</a></sup></font> Christ's whole life
was lived under the sign of persecution. His own share it with him.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-KV href="__P1L.HTM#$KV">219</a></sup></font>
Jesus' departure from Egypt recalls the exodus and presents him as the
definitive liberator of God's people.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-KW href="__P1L.HTM#$KW">220</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The
mysteries of Jesus' hidden life</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>531
During the greater part of his life Jesus shared the condition of the vast
majority of human beings: a daily life spent without evident greatness, a life
of manual labour. His religious life was that of a Jew obedient to the law of
God,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-KX href="__P1L.HTM#$KX">221</a></sup></font> a life in the community. From this whole period it is revealed
to us that Jesus was &quot;obedient&quot; to his parents and that he
&quot;increased in wisdom and in stature, and in favour with God and
man.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-KY href="__P1L.HTM#$KY">222</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>532
Jesus' obedience to his mother and legal father fulfils the fourth commandment
perfectly and was the temporal image of his filial obedience to his Father in
heaven. the everyday obedience of Jesus to Joseph and Mary both announced and
anticipated the obedience of Holy Thursday: &quot;Not my will. .
.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-KZ href="__P1L.HTM#$KZ">223</a></sup></font> The obedience of Christ in the daily routine of his hidden life
was already inaugurating his work of restoring what the disobedience of Adam
had destroyed.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-L0 href="__P1L.HTM#$L0">224</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>533
The hidden life at Nazareth allows everyone to enter into fellowship with Jesus
by the most ordinary events of daily life:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>The home of Nazareth is the
school where we begin to understand the life of Jesus - the school of the
Gospel. First, then, a lesson of silence. May esteem for silence, that
admirable and indispensable condition of mind, revive in us. . . A lesson on
family life. May Nazareth teach us what family life is, its communion of love,
its austere and simple beauty, and its sacred and inviolable character... A
lesson of work. Nazareth, home of the &quot;Carpenter's Son&quot;, in you I
would choose to understand and proclaim the severe and redeeming law of human
work. . . To conclude, I want to greet all the workers of the world, holding up
to them their great pattern their brother who is God.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-L1 href="__P1L.HTM#$L1">225</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>534
The finding of Jesus in the temple is the only event that breaks the silence of
the Gospels about the hidden years of Jesus.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-L2 href="__P1L.HTM#$L2">226</a></sup></font> Here Jesus lets us
catch a glimpse of the mystery of his total consecration to a mission that
flows from his divine sonship: &quot;Did you not know that I must be about my
Father's work?&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-L3 href="__P1L.HTM#$L3">227</a></sup></font> Mary and Joseph did not understand these words,
but they accepted them in faith. Mary &quot;kept all these things in her
heart&quot; during the years Jesus remained hidden in the silence of an
ordinary life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>III. THE
MYSTERIES OF JESUS' PUBLIC LIFE</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The baptism
of Jesus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>535
Jesus' public life begins with his baptism by John in the Jordan.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-L4 href="__P1L.HTM#$L4">228</a></sup></font>
John preaches &quot;a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of
sins&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-L5 href="__P1L.HTM#$L5">229</a></sup></font> A crowd of sinners<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-L6 href="__P1L.HTM#$L6">230</a></sup></font> - tax collectors and soldiers,
Pharisees and Sadducees, and prostitutes - come to be baptized by him.
&quot;Then Jesus appears.&quot; the Baptist hesitates, but Jesus insists and
receives baptism. Then the Holy Spirit, in the form of a dove, comes upon Jesus
and a voice from heaven proclaims, &quot;This is my beloved
Son.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-L7 href="__P1L.HTM#$L7">231</a></sup></font> This is the manifestation (&quot;Epiphany&quot;) of Jesus
as Messiah of Israel and Son of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>536
The baptism of Jesus is on his part the acceptance and inauguration of his
mission as God's suffering Servant. He allows himself to be numbered among
sinners; he is already &quot;the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the
world&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-L8 href="__P1L.HTM#$L8">232</a></sup></font> Already he is anticipating the &quot;baptism&quot; of
his bloody death.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-L9 href="__P1L.HTM#$L9">233</a></sup></font> Already he is coming to &quot;fulfil all
righteousness&quot;, that is, he is submitting himself entirely to his Father's
will: out of love he consents to this baptism of death for the remission of our
sins.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-LA href="__P1L.HTM#$LA">234</a></sup></font> The Father's voice responds to the Son's acceptance,
proclaiming his entire delight in his Son.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-LB href="__P1L.HTM#$LB">235</a></sup></font> The Spirit whom Jesus
possessed in fullness from his conception comes to &quot;rest on
him&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-LC href="__P1L.HTM#$LC">236</a></sup></font> Jesus will be the source of the Spirit for all mankind.
At his baptism &quot;the heavens were opened&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-LD href="__P1L.HTM#$LD">237</a></sup></font> - the heavens
that Adam's sin had closed - and the waters were sanctified by the descent of
Jesus and the Spirit, a prelude to the new creation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>537
Through Baptism the Christian is sacramentally assimilated to Jesus, who in his
own baptism anticipates his death and resurrection. the Christian must enter
into this mystery of humble self-abasement and repentance, go down into the

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus'
temptations</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>538
The Gospels speak of a time of solitude for Jesus in the desert immediately after
his baptism by John. Driven by the Spirit into the desert, Jesus remains there
for forty days without eating; he lives among wild beasts, and angels minister
to him.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-LH href="__P1L.HTM#$LH">241</a></sup></font> At the end of this time Satan tempts him three times,
seeking to compromise his filial attitude toward God. Jesus rebuffs these
attacks, which recapitulate the temptations of Adam in Paradise and of Israel
in the desert, and the devil leaves him &quot;until an opportune
time&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-LI href="__P1L.HTM#$LI">242</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>539
The evangelists indicate the salvific meaning of this mysterious event: Jesus
is the new Adam who remained faithful just where the first Adam had given in to
temptation. Jesus fulfils Israel's vocation perfectly: in contrast to those who
had once provoked God during forty years in the desert, Christ reveals himself
as God's Servant, totally obedient to the divine will. In this, Jesus is the
devil's conqueror: he &quot;binds the strong man&quot; to take back his
plunder.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-LJ href="__P1L.HTM#$LJ">243</a></sup></font> Jesus' victory over the tempter in the desert anticipates
victory at the Passion, the supreme act of obedience of his filial love for the
Father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>540
Jesus' temptation reveals the way in which the Son of God is Messiah, contrary
to the way Satan proposes to him and the way men wish to attribute to
him.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-LK href="__P1L.HTM#$LK">244</a></sup></font> This is why Christ vanquished the Tempter for us: &quot;For we
have not a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one
who in every respect has been tested as we are, yet without sinning.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-LL href="__P1L.HTM#$LL">245</a></sup></font>
By the solemn forty days of Lent the Church unites herself each year to the
mystery of Jesus in the desert.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The
kingdom of God is at hand&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>541
&quot;Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the
gospel of God, and saying: 'The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at
hand: repent, and believe in the gospel.'&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-LM href="__P1L.HTM#$LM">246</a></sup></font> &quot;To carry out
the will of the Father Christ inaugurated the kingdom of heaven on
earth.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-LN href="__P1L.HTM#$LN">247</a></sup></font> Now the Father's will is &quot;to raise up men to share
in his own divine life&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-LO href="__P1L.HTM#$LO">248</a></sup></font> He does this by gathering men around
his Son Jesus Christ. This gathering is the Church, &quot;on earth the seed and
beginning of that kingdoms&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-LP href="__P1L.HTM#$LP">249</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>542
Christ stands at the heart of this gathering of men into the &quot;family of
God&quot;. By his word, through signs that manifest the reign of God, and by
sending out his disciples, Jesus calls all people to come together around him.
But above all in the great Paschal mystery - his death on the cross and his
Resurrection - he would accomplish the coming of his kingdom. &quot;and I, when
I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself.&quot; Into this
union with Christ all men are called.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-LQ href="__P1L.HTM#$LQ">250</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The
proclamation of the kingdom of God</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>543
Everyone is called to enter the kingdom. First announced to the children of
Israel, this messianic kingdom is intended to accept men of all
nations.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-LR href="__P1L.HTM#$LR">251</a></sup></font> To enter it, one must first accept Jesus' word:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>The word of the Lord is
compared to a seed which is sown in a field; those who hear it with faith and
are numbered among the little flock of Christ have truly received the kingdom.
Then, by its own power, the seed sprouts and grows until the
harvest.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-LS href="__P1L.HTM#$LS">252</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>544
The kingdom belongs to the poor and lowly, which means those who have accepted
it with humble hearts. Jesus is sent to &quot;preach good news to the
poor&quot;;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-LT href="__P1L.HTM#$LT">253</a></sup></font> he declares them blessed, for &quot;theirs is the
kingdom of heaven.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-LU href="__P1L.HTM#$LU">254</a></sup></font> To them - the &quot;little ones&quot; the Father
is pleased to reveal what remains hidden from the wise and the
learned.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-LV href="__P1L.HTM#$LV">255</a></sup></font> Jesus shares the life of the poor, from the cradle to the
cross; he experiences hunger, thirst and privation.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-LW href="__P1L.HTM#$LW">256</a></sup></font> Jesus identifies
himself with the poor of every kind and makes active love toward them the
condition for entering his kingdom.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-LX href="__P1L.HTM#$LX">257</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>545
Jesus invites sinners to the table of the kingdom: &quot;I came not to call the
righteous, but sinners.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-LY href="__P1L.HTM#$LY">258</a></sup></font> He invites them to that conversion
without which one cannot enter the kingdom, but shows them in word and deed his
Father's boundless mercy for them and the vast &quot;joy in heaven over one
sinner who repents&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-LZ href="__P1L.HTM#$LZ">259</a></sup></font> The supreme proof of his love will be the
sacrifice of his own life &quot;for the forgiveness of sins&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-M0 href="__P1L.HTM#$M0">260</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>546
Jesus' invitation to enter his kingdom comes in the form of parables, a
characteristic feature of his teaching.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-M1 href="__P1L.HTM#$M1">261</a></sup></font> Through his parables he
invites people to the feast of the kingdom, but he also asks for a radical
choice: to gain the kingdom, one must give everything.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-M2 href="__P1L.HTM#$M2">262</a></sup></font> Words are not
enough, deeds are required.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-M3 href="__P1L.HTM#$M3">263</a></sup></font> The parables are like mirrors for man:
will he be hard soil or good earth for the word?<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-M4 href="__P1L.HTM#$M4">264</a></sup></font> What use has he
made of the talents he has received?<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-M5 href="__P1L.HTM#$M5">265</a></sup></font> Jesus and the presence of the
kingdom in this world are secretly at the heart of the parables. One must enter
the kingdom, that is, become a disciple of Christ, in order to &quot;know the
secrets of the kingdom of heaven&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-M6 href="__P1L.HTM#$M6">266</a></sup></font> For those who stay
&quot;outside&quot;, everything remains enigmatic.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-M7 href="__P1L.HTM#$M7">267</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The signs
of the kingdom of God</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>547
Jesus accompanies his words with many &quot;mighty works and wonders and
signs&quot;, which manifest that the kingdom is present in him and attest that
he was the promised Messiah.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-M8 href="__P1L.HTM#$M8">268</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>548
The signs worked by Jesus attest that the Father has sent him. They invite
belief in him.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-M9 href="__P1L.HTM#$M9">269</a></sup></font> To those who turn to him in faith, he grants what
they ask.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MA href="__P1L.HTM#$MA">270</a></sup></font> So miracles strengthen faith in the One who does his
Father's works; they bear witness that he is the Son of God.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MB href="__P1L.HTM#$MB">271</a></sup></font> But his
miracles can also be occasions for &quot;offence&quot;;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MC href="__P1L.HTM#$MC">272</a></sup></font> they are not
intended to satisfy people's curiosity or desire for magic Despite his evident
miracles some people reject Jesus; he is even accused of acting by the power of
demons.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MD href="__P1L.HTM#$MD">273</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>549
By freeing some individuals from the earthly evils of hunger, injustice,
illness and death,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-ME href="__P1L.HTM#$ME">274</a></sup></font> Jesus performed messianic signs. Nevertheless he
did not come to abolish all evils here below,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MF href="__P1L.HTM#$MF">275</a></sup></font> but to free men from
the gravest slavery, sin, which thwarts them in their vocation as God's sons
and causes all forms of human bondage.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MG href="__P1L.HTM#$MG">276</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>550
The coming of God's kingdom means the defeat of Satan's: &quot;If it is by the
Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon
you.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MH href="__P1L.HTM#$MH">277</a></sup></font> Jesus' exorcisms free some individuals from the domination
of demons. They anticipate Jesus' great victory over &quot;the ruler of this
world&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MI href="__P1L.HTM#$MI">278</a></sup></font> The kingdom of God will be definitively established
through Christ's cross: &quot;God reigned from the wood.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MJ href="__P1L.HTM#$MJ">279</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The
keys of the kingdom&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>551
From the beginning of his public life Jesus chose certain men, twelve in
number, to be with him and to participate in his mission.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MK href="__P1L.HTM#$MK">280</a></sup></font> He gives
the Twelve a share in his authority and 'sent them out to preach the kingdom of
God and to heal.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-ML href="__P1L.HTM#$ML">281</a></sup></font> They remain associated for ever with Christ's
kingdom, for through them he directs the Church:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>As my Father appointed a
kingdom for me, so do I appoint for you that you may eat and drink at my table
in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of
Israel.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MM href="__P1L.HTM#$MM">282</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>552
Simon Peter holds the first place in the college of the Twelve;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MN href="__P1L.HTM#$MN">283</a></sup></font>
Jesus entrusted a unique mission to him. Through a revelation from the Father,
Peter had confessed: &quot;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.&quot;
Our Lord then declared to him: &quot;You are Peter, and on this rock I will
build my Church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against
it.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MO href="__P1L.HTM#$MO">284</a></sup></font> Christ, the &quot;living Stone&quot;,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MP href="__P1L.HTM#$MP">285</a></sup></font> thus
assures his Church, built on Peter, of victory over the powers of death.
Because of the faith he confessed Peter will remain the unshakeable rock of the
Church. His mission will be to keep this faith from every lapse and to
strengthen his brothers in it.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MQ href="__P1L.HTM#$MQ">286</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>553
Jesus entrusted a specific authority to Peter: &quot;I will give you the keys
of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in
heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in
heaven.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MR href="__P1L.HTM#$MR">287</a></sup></font> The &quot;power of the keys&quot; designates authority
to govern the house of God, which is the Church. Jesus, the Good Shepherd,
confirmed this mandate after his Resurrection: &quot;Feed my
sheep.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MS href="__P1L.HTM#$MS">288</a></sup></font> The power to &quot;bind and loose&quot; connotes the
authority to absolve sins, to pronounce doctrinal judgements, and to make
disciplinary decisions in the Church. Jesus entrusted this authority to the
Church through the ministry of the apostles<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MT href="__P1L.HTM#$MT">289</a></sup></font> and in particular
through the ministry of Peter, the only one to whom he specifically entrusted
the keys of the kingdom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A foretaste
of the kingdom: the Transfiguration</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>554
From the day Peter confessed that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living
God, the Master &quot;began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem
and suffer many things. . . and be killed, and on the third day be
raised.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MU href="__P1L.HTM#$MU">290</a></sup></font> Peter scorns this prediction, nor do the others
understand it any better than he.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MV href="__P1L.HTM#$MV">291</a></sup></font> In this context the mysterious
episode of Jesus' Transfiguration takes place on a high mountain,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MW href="__P1L.HTM#$MW">292</a></sup></font>
before three witnesses chosen by himself: Peter, James and John. Jesus' face
and clothes become dazzling with light, and Moses and Elijah appear, speaking
&quot;of his departure, which he was to accomplish at
Jerusalem&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MX href="__P1L.HTM#$MX">293</a></sup></font> A cloud covers him and a voice from heaven says:
&quot;This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MY href="__P1L.HTM#$MY">294</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>555
For a moment Jesus discloses his divine glory, confirming Peter's confession.
He also reveals that he will have to go by the way of the cross at Jerusalem in
order to &quot;enter into his glory&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MZ href="__P1L.HTM#$MZ">295</a></sup></font> <br>
Moses and Elijah had seen God's glory on the Mountain; the Law and the Prophets
had announced the Messiah's sufferings.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-N0 href="__P1L.HTM#$N0">296</a></sup></font> Christ's Passion is the will
of the Father: the Son acts as God's servant;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-N1 href="__P1L.HTM#$N1">297</a></sup></font> The cloud indicates
the presence of the Holy Spirit. &quot;The whole Trinity appeared: the Father
in the voice; the Son in the man; the Spirit in the shining
cloud.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-N2 href="__P1L.HTM#$N2">298</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>You were transfigured on the
mountain, and your disciples, as much as they were capable of it, beheld your
glory, O Christ our God, so that when they should see you crucified they would
understand that your Passion was voluntary, and proclaim to the world that you
truly are the splendour of the Father.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-N3 href="__P1L.HTM#$N3">299</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>556
On the threshold of the public life: the baptism; on the threshold of the
Passover: the Transfiguration. Jesus' baptism proclaimed &quot;the mystery of
the first regeneration&quot;, namely, our Baptism; the Transfiguration &quot;is
the sacrament of the second regeneration&quot;: our own
Resurrection.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-N4 href="__P1L.HTM#$N4">300</a></sup></font> From now on we share in the Lord's Resurrection
through the Spirit who acts in the sacraments of the Body of Christ. the
Transfiguration gives us a foretaste of Christ's glorious coming, when he &quot;will
change our lowly body to be like his glorious body.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-N5 href="__P1L.HTM#$N5">301</a></sup></font> But it
also recalls that &quot;it is through many persecutions that we must enter the
kingdom of God&quot;:<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-N6 href="__P1L.HTM#$N6">302</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>Peter did not yet understand
this when he wanted to remain with Christ on the mountain. It has been reserved
for you, Peter, but for after death. For now, Jesus says: &quot;Go down to toil
on earth, to serve on earth, to be scorned and crucified on earth. Life goes
down to be killed; Bread goes down to suffer hunger; the Way goes down to be
exhausted on his journey; the Spring goes down to suffer thirst; and you refuse
to suffer?&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-N7 href="__P1L.HTM#$N7">303</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus'
ascent to Jerusalem</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>557
&quot;When the days drew near for him to be taken up [Jesus] set his face to go
to Jerusalem.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-N8 href="__P1L.HTM#$N8">304</a></sup></font> By this decision he indicated that he was going
up to Jerusalem prepared to die there. Three times he had announced his Passion
and Resurrection; now, heading toward Jerusalem, Jesus says: &quot;It cannot be
that a prophet should perish away from Jerusalem.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-N9 href="__P1L.HTM#$N9">305</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>558
Jesus recalls the martyrdom of the prophets who had been put to death in
Jerusalem. Nevertheless he persists in calling Jerusalem to gather around him:
&quot;How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers
her brood under her wings, and you would not!&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-NA href="__P1L.HTM#$NA">306</a></sup></font> When Jerusalem
comes into view he weeps over her and expresses once again his heart's desire:
&quot;Would that even today you knew the things that make for peace! But now
they are hid from your eyes.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-NB href="__P1L.HTM#$NB">307</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus'
messianic entrance into Jerusalem</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>559
How will Jerusalem welcome her Messiah? Although Jesus had always refused
popular attempts to make him king, he chooses the time and prepares the details
for his messianic entry into the city of &quot;his father
David&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-NC href="__P1L.HTM#$NC">308</a></sup></font> Acclaimed as son of David, as the one who brings
salvation (Hosanna means &quot;Save!&quot; or &quot;Give salvation!&quot;), the
&quot;King of glory&quot; enters his City &quot;riding on an ass&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-ND href="__P1L.HTM#$ND">309</a></sup></font>
Jesus conquers the Daughter of Zion, a figure of his Church, neither by ruse
nor by violence, but by the humility that bears witness to the
truth.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-NE href="__P1L.HTM#$NE">310</a></sup></font> and so the subjects of his kingdom on that day are children
and God's poor, who acclaim him as had the angels when they announced him to
the shepherds.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-NF href="__P1L.HTM#$NF">311</a></sup></font> Their acclamation, &quot;Blessed be he who comes in
the name of the Lord&quot;,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-NG href="__P1L.HTM#$NG">312</a></sup></font> is taken up by the Church in the Sanctus
of the Eucharistic liturgy that introduces the memorial of the Lord's Passover.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>560
Jesus' entry into Jerusalem manifested the coming of the kingdom that the
King-Messiah was going to accomplish by the Passover of his Death and
Resurrection. It is with the celebration of that entry on Palm Sunday that the
Church's liturgy solemnly opens Holy Week.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>IN BRIEF</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>561 &quot;The whole of
Christ's life was a continual teaching: his silences, his miracles, his
gestures, his prayer, his love for people, his special affection for the little
and the poor, his acceptance of the total sacrifice on the Cross for the
redemption of the world, and his Resurrection are the actualization of his word
and the fulfilment of Revelation&quot; John Paul II, CT 9).</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>562 Christ's disciples are to
conform themselves to him until he is formed in them (cf Gal
4:19). &quot;For this reason we, who have been made like to him, who
have died with him and risen with him, are taken up into the mysteries of his
life, until we reign together with him&quot; (LG 7 # 4).</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>563 No one, whether shepherd
or wise man, can approach God here below except by kneeling before the manger
at Bethlehem and adoring him hidden in the weakness of a new-born child.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>564 By his obedience to Mary
and Joseph, as well as by his humble work during the long years in Nazareth,
Jesus gives us the example of holiness in the daily life of family and work.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>565 From the beginning of his
public life, at his baptism, Jesus is the &quot;Servant&quot;, wholly

&quot;baptism&quot; of his Passion.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>566 The temptation in the

adherence to the plan of salvation willed by the Father.</i></p>

inaugurated on earth by Christ. &quot;This kingdom shone out before men in the

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>568 Christ's Transfiguration
aims at strengthening the apostles' faith in anticipation of his Passion: the
ascent on to the &quot;high mountain&quot; prepares for the ascent to Calvary.

the sacraments: &quot;the hope of glory&quot; (Col
