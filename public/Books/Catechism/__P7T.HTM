<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>II. The </b><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>Family and Society</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2207
The family is the original cell of social life. It is the natural society in
which husband and wife are called to give themselves in love and in the gift of
life. Authority, stability, and a life of relationships within the family
constitute the foundations for freedom, security, and fraternity within
society. the family is the community in which, from childhood, one can learn
moral values, begin to honor God, and make good use of freedom. Family life is
an initiation into life in society.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2208
The family should live in such a way that its members learn to care and take
responsibility for the young, the old, the sick, the handicapped, and the poor.
There are many families who are at times incapable of providing this help. It
devolves then on other persons, other families, and, in a subsidiary way,
society to provide for their needs: &quot;Religion that is pure and undefiled
before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their
affliction and to keep oneself unstained from the world.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2AK href="__P7T.HTM#$2AK">12</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2209
The family must be helped and defended by appropriate social measures. Where
families cannot fulfill their responsibilities, other social bodies have the
duty of helping them and of supporting the institution of the family. Following
the principle of subsidiarity, larger communities should take care not to usurp
the family's prerogatives or interfere in its life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2210
The importance of the family for the life and well-being of society<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2AL href="__P7T.HTM#$2AL">13</a></sup></font>
entails a particular responsibility for society to support and strengthen
marriage and the family. Civil authority should consider it a grave duty
&quot;to acknowledge the true nature of marriage and the family, to protect and
foster them, to safeguard public morality, and promote domestic
prosperity.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2AM href="__P7T.HTM#$2AM">14</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2211
The
political community has a duty to honor the family, to assist it, and to ensure
especially: <br>
- the freedom to establish a family, have children, and bring them up in
keeping with the family's own moral and religious convictions; <br>
- the protection of the stability of the marriage bond and the institution of
the family; <br>
- the freedom to profess one's faith, to hand it on, and raise one's children
in it, with the necessary means and institutions; <br>
- the right to private property, to free enterprise, to obtain work and
housing, and the right to emigrate; <br>
- in keeping with the country's institutions, the right to medical care,
assistance for the aged, and family benefits; <br>
- the protection of security and health, especially with respect to dangers
like drugs, pornography, alcoholism, etc.; <br>
- the freedom to form associations with other families and so to have
representation before civil authority.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2AN href="__P7T.HTM#$2AN">15</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2212
The fourth commandment illuminates other relationships in society. In our
brothers and sisters we see the children of our parents; in our cousins, the
descendants of our ancestors; in our fellow citizens, the children of our
country; in the baptized, the children of our mother the Church; in every human
person, a son or daughter of the One who wants to be called &quot;our Father.&quot;
In this way our relationships with our neighbors are recognized as personal in
character. the neighbor is not a &quot;unit&quot; in the human collective; he
is &quot;someone&quot; who by his known origins deserves particular attention
and respect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2213
Human communities are made up of persons. Governing them well is not limited to
guaranteeing rights and fulfilling duties such as honoring contracts. Right
relations between employers and employees, between those who govern and
citizens, presuppose a natural good will in keeping with the dignity of human
persons concerned for justice and fraternity.</p>
