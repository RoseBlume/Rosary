<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Paragraph 7. THE FALL</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>385
God is infinitely good and all his works are good. Yet no one can escape the
experience of suffering or the evils in nature which seem to be linked to the
limitations proper to creatures: and above all to the question of moral evil.
Where does evil come from? &quot;I sought whence evil comes and there was no
solution&quot;, said St. Augustine,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-DD href="__P1C.HTM#$DD">257</a></sup></font> and his own painful quest would
only be resolved by his conversion to the living God. For &quot;the mystery of
lawlessness&quot; is clarified only in the light of the &quot;mystery of our
religion&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-DE href="__P1C.HTM#$DE">258</a></sup></font> The revelation of divine love in Christ manifested
at the same time the extent of evil and the superabundance of grace.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-DF href="__P1C.HTM#$DF">259</a></sup></font>
We must therefore approach the question of the origin of evil by fixing the
eyes of our faith on him who alone is its conqueror.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-DG href="__P1C.HTM#$DG">260</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I. WHERE
SIN ABOUNDED, GRACE ABOUNDED ALL THE MORE</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The reality
of sin</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>386
Sin is present in human history; any attempt to ignore it or to give this dark
reality other names would be futile. To try to understand what sin is, one must
first recognize the profound relation of man to God, for only in this
relationship is the evil of sin unmasked in its true identity as humanity's
rejection of God and opposition to him, even as it continues to weigh heavy on
human life and history.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>387
Only the light of divine Revelation clarifies the reality of sin and
particularly of the sin committed at mankind's origins. Without the knowledge
Revelation gives of God we cannot recognize sin clearly and are tempted to
explain it as merely a developmental flaw, a psychological weakness, a mistake,
or the necessary consequence of an inadequate social structure, etc. Only in
the knowledge of God's plan for man can we grasp that sin is an abuse of the
freedom that God gives to created persons so that they are capable of loving
him and loving one another.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Original
sin - an essential truth of the faith</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>388
With the progress of Revelation, the reality of sin is also illuminated.
Although to some extent the People of God in the Old Testament had tried to
understand the pathos of the human condition in the light of the history of the
fall narrated in Genesis, they could not grasp this story's ultimate meaning,
which is revealed only in the light of the death and Resurrection of Jesus
Christ.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-DH href="__P1C.HTM#$DH">261</a></sup></font> We must know Christ as the source of grace in order to know
Adam as the source of sin. the Spirit-Paraclete, sent by the risen Christ, came
to &quot;convict the world concerning sin&quot;,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-DI href="__P1C.HTM#$DI">262</a></sup></font> by revealing him
who is its Redeemer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>389
The doctrine of original sin is, so to speak, the &quot;reverse side&quot; of
the Good News that Jesus is the Saviour of all men, that all need salvation and
that salvation is offered to all through Christ. the Church, which has the mind
of Christ,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-DJ href="__P1C.HTM#$DJ">263</a></sup></font> knows very well that we cannot tamper with the revelation
of original sin without undermining the mystery of Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How to read
the account of the fall</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>390
The account of the fall in Genesis 3 uses figurative language, but affirms a
primeval event, a deed that took place at the beginning of the history of
man.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-DK href="__P1C.HTM#$DK">264</a></sup></font> Revelation gives us the certainty of faith that the whole of
human history is marked by the original fault freely committed by our first
parents.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-DL href="__P1C.HTM#$DL">265</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>II. THE
FALL OF THE ANGELS</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>391
Behind the disobedient choice of our first parents lurks a seductive voice,
opposed to God, which makes them fall into death out of envy.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-DM href="__P1C.HTM#$DM">266</a></sup></font>
Scripture and the Church's Tradition see in this being a fallen angel, called
&quot;Satan&quot; or the &quot;devil&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-DN href="__P1C.HTM#$DN">267</a></sup></font> The Church teaches that
Satan was at first a good angel, made by God: &quot;The devil and the other
demons were indeed created naturally good by God, but they became evil by their
own doing.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-DO href="__P1C.HTM#$DO">268</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>392
Scripture speaks of a sin of these angels.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-DP href="__P1C.HTM#$DP">269</a></sup></font> This &quot;fall&quot;
consists in the free choice of these created spirits, who radically and
irrevocably rejected God and his reign. We find a reflection of that rebellion
in the tempter's words to our first parents: &quot;You will be like God.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-DQ href="__P1C.HTM#$DQ">270</a></sup></font>
The devil &quot;has sinned from the beginning&quot;; he is &quot;a liar and the
father of lies&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-DR href="__P1C.HTM#$DR">271</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>393
It is the irrevocable character of their choice, and not a defect in the
infinite divine mercy, that makes the angels' sin unforgivable. &quot;There is
no repentance for the angels after their fall, just as there is no repentance
for men after death.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-DS href="__P1C.HTM#$DS">272</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>394
Scripture witnesses to the disastrous influence of the one Jesus calls &quot;a
murderer from the beginning&quot;, who would even try to divert Jesus from the
mission received from his Father.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-DT href="__P1C.HTM#$DT">273</a></sup></font> &quot;The reason the Son of God
appeared was to destroy the works of the devil.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-DU href="__P1C.HTM#$DU">274</a></sup></font> In its
consequences the gravest of these works was the mendacious seduction that led
man to disobey God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>395
The power of Satan is, nonetheless, not infinite. He is only a creature,
powerful from the fact that he is pure spirit, but still a creature. He cannot
prevent the building up of God's reign. Although Satan may act in the world out
of hatred for God and his kingdom in Christ Jesus, and although his action may
cause grave injuries - of a spiritual nature and, indirectly, even of a
physical nature - to each man and to society, the action is permitted by divine
providence which with strength and gentleness guides human and cosmic history.
It is a great mystery that providence should permit diabolical activity, but
&quot;we know that in everything God works for good with those who love
him.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-DV href="__P1C.HTM#$DV">275</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>III.
ORIGINAL SIN</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Freedom put
to the test</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>396
God created man in his image and established him in his friendship. A spiritual
creature, man can live this friendship only in free submission to God. the
prohibition against eating &quot;of the tree of the knowledge of good and
evil&quot; spells this out: &quot;for in the day that you eat of it, you shall
die.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-DW href="__P1C.HTM#$DW">276</a></sup></font> The &quot;tree of the knowledge of good and
evil&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-DX href="__P1C.HTM#$DX">277</a></sup></font> symbolically evokes the insurmountable limits that man,
being a creature, must freely recognize and respect with trust. Man is
dependent on his Creator, and subject to the laws of creation and to the moral
norms that govern the use of freedom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Man's first
sin</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>397
Man, tempted by the devil, let his trust in his Creator die in his heart and,
abusing his freedom, disobeyed God's command. This is what man's first sin
consisted of.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-DY href="__P1C.HTM#$DY">278</a></sup></font> All subsequent sin would be disobedience toward God
and lack of trust in his goodness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>398
In that sin man preferred himself to God and by that very act scorned him. He
chose himself over and against God, against the requirements of his creaturely
status and therefore against his own good. Created in a state of holiness, man
was destined to be fully &quot;divinized&quot; by God in glory. Seduced by the
devil, he wanted to &quot;be like God&quot;, but &quot;without God, before God,
and not in accordance with God&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-DZ href="__P1C.HTM#$DZ">279</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>399
Scripture portrays the tragic consequences of this first disobedience. Adam and
Eve immediately lose the grace of original holiness.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-E0 href="__P1C.HTM#$E0">280</a></sup></font> They become
afraid of the God of whom they have conceived a distorted image - that of a God
jealous of his prerogatives.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-E1 href="__P1C.HTM#$E1">281</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>400
The harmony in which they had found themselves, thanks to original justice, is
now destroyed: the control of the soul's spiritual faculties over the body is
shattered; the union of man and woman becomes subject to tensions, their
relations henceforth marked by lust and domination.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-E2 href="__P1C.HTM#$E2">282</a></sup></font> Harmony with
creation is broken: visible creation has become alien and hostile to
man.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-E3 href="__P1C.HTM#$E3">283</a></sup></font> Because of man, creation is now subject &quot;to its bondage to
decay&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-E4 href="__P1C.HTM#$E4">284</a></sup></font> Finally, the consequence explicitly foretold for this
disobedience will come true: man will &quot;return to the
ground&quot;,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-E5 href="__P1C.HTM#$E5">285</a></sup></font> for out of it he was taken. Death makes its entrance
into human history.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-E6 href="__P1C.HTM#$E6">286</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>401
After that first sin, the world is virtually inundated by sin There is Cain's
murder of his brother Abel and the universal corruption which follows in the
wake of sin. Likewise, sin frequently manifests itself in the history of
Israel, especially as infidelity to the God of the Covenant and as
transgression of the Law of Moses. and even after Christ's atonement, sin
raises its head in countless ways among Christians.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-E7 href="__P1C.HTM#$E7">287</a></sup></font> Scripture and
the Church's Tradition continually recall the presence and universality of sin
in man's history:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>What Revelation makes known to
us is confirmed by our own experience. For when man looks into his own heart he
finds that he is drawn towards what is wrong and sunk in many evils which
cannot come from his good creator. Often refusing to acknowledge God as his
source, man has also upset the relationship which should link him to his last
end, and at the same time he has broken the right order that should reign
within himself as well as between himself and other men and all
creatures.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-E8 href="__P1C.HTM#$E8">288</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The
consequences of Adam's sin for humanity</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>402
All men are implicated in Adam's sin, as St. Paul affirms: &quot;By one man's
disobedience many (that is, all men) were made sinners&quot;: &quot;sin came
into the world through one man and death through sin, and so death spread to
all men because all men sinned.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-E9 href="__P1C.HTM#$E9">289</a></sup></font> The Apostle contrasts the
universality of sin and death with the universality of salvation in Christ.
&quot;Then as one man's trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one man's
act of righteousness leads to acquittal and life for all men.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-EA href="__P1C.HTM#$EA">290</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>403
Following St. Paul, the Church has always taught that the overwhelming misery
which oppresses men and their inclination towards evil and death cannot be
understood apart from their connection with Adam's sin and the fact that he has
transmitted to us a sin with which we are all born afflicted, a sin which is
the &quot;death of the soul&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-EB href="__P1C.HTM#$EB">291</a></sup></font> Because of this certainty of
faith, the Church baptizes for the remission of sins even tiny infants who have
not committed personal sin.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-EC href="__P1C.HTM#$EC">292</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>404
How did the sin of Adam become the sin of all his descendants? the whole human
race is in Adam &quot;as one body of one man&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-ED href="__P1C.HTM#$ED">293</a></sup></font> By this
&quot;unity of the human race&quot; all men are implicated in Adam's sin, as
all are implicated in Christ's justice. Still, the transmission of original sin
is a mystery that we cannot fully understand. But we do know by Revelation that
Adam had received original holiness and justice not for himself alone, but for
all human nature. By yielding to the tempter, Adam and Eve committed a personal
sin, but this sin affected the human nature that they would then transmit in a
fallen state.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-EE href="__P1C.HTM#$EE">294</a></sup></font> It is a sin which will be transmitted by propagation
to all mankind, that is, by the transmission of a human nature deprived of
original holiness and justice. and that is why original sin is called
&quot;sin&quot; only in an analogical sense: it is a sin &quot;contracted&quot;
and not &quot;committed&quot; - a state and not an act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>405
Although it is proper to each individual,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-EF href="__P1C.HTM#$EF">295</a></sup></font> original sin does not have
the character of a personal fault in any of Adam's descendants. It is a
deprivation of original holiness and justice, but human nature has not been
totally corrupted: it is wounded in the natural powers proper to it, subject to
ignorance, suffering and the dominion of death, and inclined to sin - an
inclination to evil that is called concupiscence&quot;. Baptism, by imparting
the life of Christ's grace, erases original sin and turns a man back towards God,
but the consequences for nature, weakened and inclined to evil, persist in man
and summon him to spiritual battle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>406
The
Church's teaching on the transmission of original sin was articulated more
precisely in the fifth century, especially under the impulse of St. Augustine's
reflections against Pelagianism, and in the sixteenth century, in opposition to
the Protestant Reformation. Pelagius held that man could, by the natural power
of free will and without the necessary help of God's grace, lead a morally good
life; he thus reduced the influence of Adam's fault to bad example. the first
Protestant reformers, on the contrary, taught that original sin has radically
perverted man and destroyed his freedom; they identified the sin inherited by each
man with the tendency to evil (concupiscentia), which would be insurmountable.
the Church pronounced on the meaning of the data of Revelation on original sin
especially at the second Council of Orange (529)<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-EG href="__P1C.HTM#$EG">296</a></sup></font> and at the Council
of Trent (1546).<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-EH href="__P1C.HTM#$EH">297</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A hard
battle. . .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>407
The doctrine of original sin, closely connected with that of redemption by
Christ, provides lucid discernment of man's situation and activity in the
world. By our first parents' sin, the devil has acquired a certain domination
over man, even though man remains free. Original sin entails &quot;captivity
under the power of him who thenceforth had the power of death, that is, the
devil&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-EI href="__P1C.HTM#$EI">298</a></sup></font> Ignorance of the fact that man has a wounded nature inclined
to evil gives rise to serious errors in the areas of education, politics,
social action<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-EJ href="__P1C.HTM#$EJ">299</a></sup></font> and morals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>408
The consequences of original sin and of all men's personal sins put the world
as a whole in the sinful condition aptly described in St. John's expression,
&quot;the sin of the world&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-EK href="__P1C.HTM#$EK">300</a></sup></font> This expression can also refer to
the negative influence exerted on people by communal situations and social
structures that are the fruit of men's sins.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-EL href="__P1C.HTM#$EL">301</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>409
This dramatic situation of &quot;the whole world [which] is in the power of the
evil one&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-EM href="__P1C.HTM#$EM">302</a></sup></font> makes man's life a battle:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>The whole of man's history has
been the story of dour combat with the powers of evil, stretching, so our Lord
tells us, from the very dawn of history until the last day. Finding himself in
the midst of the battlefield man has to struggle to do what is right, and it is
at great cost to himself, and aided by God's grace, that he succeeds in
achieving his own inner integrity.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-EN href="__P1C.HTM#$EN">303</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>IV.
&quot;YOU DID NOT ABANDON HIM TO THE POWER OF DEATH&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>410
After his fall, man was not abandoned by God. On the contrary, God calls him
and in a mysterious way heralds the coming victory over evil and his
restoration from his fall.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-EO href="__P1C.HTM#$EO">304</a></sup></font> This passage in Genesis is called the
Protoevangelium (&quot;first gospel&quot;): the first announcement of the
Messiah and Redeemer, of a battle between the serpent and the Woman, and of the
final victory of a descendant of hers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>411
The Christian tradition sees in this passage an announcement of the &quot;New
Adam&quot; who, because he &quot;became obedient unto death, even death on a
cross&quot;, makes amends superabundantly for the disobedience, of
Adam.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-EP href="__P1C.HTM#$EP">305</a></sup></font> Furthermore many Fathers and Doctors of the Church have seen
the woman announced in the &quot;Proto-evangelium&quot; as Mary, the mother of
Christ, the &quot;new Eve&quot;. Mary benefited first of all and uniquely from
Christ's victory over sin: she was preserved from all stain of original sin and
by a special grace of God committed no sin of any kind during her whole earthly
life.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-EQ href="__P1C.HTM#$EQ">306</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>412
But why did God not prevent the first man from sinning? St. Leo the Great
responds, &quot;Christ's inexpressible grace gave us blessings better than
those the demon's envy had taken away.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-ER href="__P1C.HTM#$ER">307</a></sup></font> and St. Thomas Aquinas
wrote, &quot;There is nothing to prevent human nature's being raised up to
something greater, even after sin; God permits evil in order to draw forth some
greater good. Thus St. Paul says, 'Where sin increased, grace abounded all the
more'; and the Exsultet sings, 'O happy fault,. . . which gained for us so
great a Redeemer!'&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-ES href="__P1C.HTM#$ES">308</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>IN BRIEF</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>413 &quot;God did not make
death, and he does not delight in the death of the living. . . It was through
the devil's envy that death entered the world&quot;
(Wis 1:13;
2:24).</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>414 Satan or the devil and
the other demons are fallen angels who have freely refused to serve God and his
plan. Their choice against God is definitive. They try to associate man in
their revolt against God.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>415 &quot;Although set by God
in a state of rectitude man, enticed by the evil one, abused his freedom at the
very start of history. He lifted himself up against God, and sought to attain
his goal apart from him&quot; (GS 13 # 1).</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>416 By his sin Adam, as the
first man, lost the original holiness and justice he had received from God, not
only for himself but for all human beings.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>417 Adam and Eve transmitted
to their descendants human nature wounded by their own first sin and hence
deprived of original holiness and justice; this deprivation is called
&quot;original sin&quot;.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>418 As a result of original
sin, human nature is weakened in its powers, subject to ignorance, suffering
and the domination of death, and inclined to sin (this inclination is called
&quot;concupiscence&quot;).</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>419 &quot;We therefore hold, with
