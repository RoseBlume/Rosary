<p class=MsoNormal>2709
What is contemplative prayer? St. Teresa answers: &quot;Contemplative prayer
[oracion mental] in my opinion is nothing else than a close sharing between
friends; it means taking time frequently to be alone with him who we know loves
us.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2PC href="__P9M.HTM#$2PC">6</a></sup></font> <br>
Contemplative prayer seeks him &quot;whom my soul loves.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2PD href="__P9M.HTM#$2PD">7</a></sup></font> It is
Jesus, and in him, the Father. We seek him, because to desire him is always the
beginning of love, and we seek him in that pure faith which causes us to be
born of him and to live in him. In this inner prayer we can still meditate, but
our attention is fixed on the Lord himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2710
The choice of the time and duration of the prayer arises from a determined
will, revealing the secrets of the heart. One does not undertake contemplative
prayer only when one has the time: one makes time for the Lord, with the firm
determination not to give up, no matter what trials and dryness one may
encounter. One cannot always meditate, but one can always enter into inner
prayer, independently of the conditions of health, work, or emotional state. the
heart is the place of this quest and encounter, in poverty ant in faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2711
Entering into contemplative prayer is like entering into the Eucharistic
liturgy: we &quot;gather up:&quot; the heart, recollect our whole being under the
prompting of the Holy Spirit, abide in the dwelling place of the Lord which we
are, awaken our faith in order to enter into the presence of him who awaits us.
We let our masks fall and turn our hearts back to the Lord who loves us, so as
to hand ourselves over to him as an offering to be purified and transformed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2712
Contemplative prayer is the prayer of the child of God, of the forgiven sinner
who agrees to welcome the love by which he is loved and who wants to respond to
it by loving even more.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2PE href="__P9M.HTM#$2PE">8</a></sup></font> But he knows that the love he is returning is
poured out by the Spirit in his heart, for everything is grace from God.
Contemplative prayer is the poor and humble surrender to the loving will of the
Father in ever deeper union with his beloved Son.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2713
Contemplative prayer is the simplest expression of the mystery of prayer. It is
a gift, a grace; it can be accepted only in humility and poverty. Contemplative
prayer is a covenant relationship established by God within our
hearts.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2PF href="__P9M.HTM#$2PF">9</a></sup></font> Contemplative prayer is a communion in which the Holy Trinity
conforms man, the image of God, &quot;to his likeness.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2714
Contemplative prayer is also the pre-eminently intense time of prayer. In it
the Father strengthens our inner being with power through his Spirit &quot;that
Christ may dwell in (our) hearts through faith&quot; and we may be
&quot;grounded in love.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2PG href="__P9M.HTM#$2PG">10</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2715
Contemplation is a gaze of faith, fixed on Jesus. &quot;I look at him and he
looks at me&quot;: this is what a certain peasant of Ars used to say to his
holy cure about his prayer before the tabernacle. This focus on Jesus is a
renunciation of self. His gaze purifies our heart; the light of the countenance
of Jesus illumines the eyes of our heart and teaches us to see everything in
the light of his truth and his compassion for all men. Contemplation also turns
its gaze on the mysteries of the life of Christ. Thus it learns the
&quot;interior knowledge of our Lord,&quot; the more to love him and follow
him.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2PH href="__P9M.HTM#$2PH">11</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2716
Contemplative prayer is hearing the Word of God. Far from being passive, such
attentiveness is the obedience of faith, the unconditional acceptance of a
servant, and the loving commitment of a child. It participates in the &quot;Yes&quot;
of the Son become servant and the Fiat of God's lowly handmaid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2717
Contemplative prayer is silence, the &quot;symbol of the world to
come&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2PI href="__P9M.HTM#$2PI">12</a></sup></font> or &quot;silent love.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2PJ href="__P9M.HTM#$2PJ">13</a></sup></font> Words in this kind
of prayer are not speeches; they are like kindling that feeds the fire of love.
In this silence, unbearable to the &quot;outer&quot; man, the Father speaks to
us his incarnate Word, who suffered, died, and rose; in this silence the Spirit
of adoption enables us to share in the prayer of Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2718
Contemplative prayer is a union with the prayer of Christ insofar as it makes
us participate in his mystery. the mystery of Christ is celebrated by the
Church in the Eucharist, and the Holy Spirit makes it come alive in
contemplative prayer so that our charity will manifest it in our acts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2719
Contemplative prayer is a communion of love bearing Life for the multitude, to
the extent that it consents to abide in the night of faith. the Paschal night
of the Resurrection passes through the night of the agony and the tomb - the
three intense moments of the Hour of Jesus which his Spirit (and not &quot;the
flesh [which] is weak&quot;) brings to life in prayer. We must be willing to
&quot;keep watch with (him) one hour.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2PK href="__P9M.HTM#$2PK">14</a></sup></font></p>
