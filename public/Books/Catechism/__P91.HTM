<p class=MsoNormal>2568
In the Old Testament, the revelation of prayer comes between the fall and the
restoration of man, that is, between God's sorrowful call to his first
children: &quot;Where are you? . . . What is this that you have
done?&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2K9 href="__P91.HTM#$2K9">3</a></sup></font> and the response of God's only Son on coming into the
world: &quot;Lo, I have come to do your will, O God.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2KA href="__P91.HTM#$2KA">4</a></sup></font> Prayer is
bound up with human history, for it is the relationship with God in historical
events.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Creation -
source of prayer</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2569
Prayer is lived in the first place beginning with the realities of creation.
the first nine chapters of Genesis describe this relationship with God as an
offering of the first-born of Abel's flock, as the invocation of the divine
name at the time of Enosh, and as &quot;walking with God.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2KB href="__P91.HTM#$2KB">5</a></sup></font> Noah's
offering is pleasing to God, who blesses him and through him all creation,
because his heart was upright and undivided; Noah, like Enoch before him,
&quot;walks with God.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2KC href="__P91.HTM#$2KC">6</a></sup></font> This kind of prayer is lived by many
righteous people in all religions. <br>
In his indefectible covenant with every living creature,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2KD href="__P91.HTM#$2KD">7</a></sup></font> God has
always called people to prayer. But it is above all beginning with our father
Abraham that prayer is revealed in the Old Testament.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>God's
promise and the prayer of Faith</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2570
When God calls him, Abraham goes forth &quot;as the Lord had told
him&quot;;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2KE href="__P91.HTM#$2KE">8</a></sup></font> Abraham's heart is entirely submissive to the Word and so
he obeys. Such attentiveness of the heart, whose decisions are made according
to God's will, is essential to prayer, while the words used count only in
relation to it. Abraham's prayer is expressed first by deeds: a man of silence,
he constructs an altar to the Lord at each stage of his journey. Only later
does Abraham's first prayer in words appear: a veiled complaint reminding God
of his promises which seem unfulfilled.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2KF href="__P91.HTM#$2KF">9</a></sup></font> Thus one aspect of the drama
of prayer appears from the beginning: the test of faith in the fidelity of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2571
Because Abraham believed in God and walked in his presence and in covenant with
him,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2KG href="__P91.HTM#$2KG">10</a></sup></font> The patriarch is ready to welcome a mysterious Guest into his
tent. Abraham's remarkable hospitality at Mamre foreshadows the annunciation of
the true Son of the promise.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2KH href="__P91.HTM#$2KH">11</a></sup></font> After that, once God had confided his
plan, Abraham's heart is attuned to his Lord's compassion for men and he dares
to intercede for them with bold confidence.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2KI href="__P91.HTM#$2KI">12</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2572
As a final stage in the purification of his faith, Abraham, &quot;who had
received the promises,&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2KJ href="__P91.HTM#$2KJ">13</a></sup></font> is asked to sacrifice the son God had
given him. Abraham's faith does not weaken (&ldquo;God himself will provide the lamb
for a burnt offering.&quot;), for he &quot;considered that God was able to
raise men even from the dead.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2KK href="__P91.HTM#$2KK">14</a></sup></font> and so the father of believers is
conformed to the likeness of the Father who will not spare his own Son but wiLl
deliver him up for us all.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2KL href="__P91.HTM#$2KL">15</a></sup></font> Prayer restores man to God's likeness and
enables him to share in the power of God's love that saves the
multitude.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2KM href="__P91.HTM#$2KM">16</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2573
God renews his promise to Jacob, the ancestor of the twelve tribes of
Israel.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2KN href="__P91.HTM#$2KN">17</a></sup></font> Before confronting his elder brother Esau, Jacob wrestles all
night with a mysterious figure who refuses to reveal his name, but he blesses
him before leaving him at dawn. From this account, the spiritual tradition of
the Church has retained the symbol of prayer as a battle of faith and as the
triumph of perseverance.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2KO href="__P91.HTM#$2KO">18</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Moses and
the prayer of the mediator</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2574
Once the promise begins to be fulfilled (Passover, the Exodus, the gift of the
Law, and the ratification of the covenant), the prayer of Moses becomes the
most striking example of intercessory prayer, which will be fulfilled in
&quot;the one mediator between God and men, the man Christ
Jesus.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2KP href="__P91.HTM#$2KP">19</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2575
Here again the initiative is God's. From the midst of the burning bush he calls
Moses.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2KQ href="__P91.HTM#$2KQ">20</a></sup></font> This event will remain one of the primordial images of prayer
in the spiritual tradition of Jews and Christians alike. When &quot;the God of
Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob&quot; calls Moses to be his servant, it is
because he is the living God who wants men to live. God reveals himself in
order to save them, though he does not do this alone or despite them: he caLls
Moses to be his messenger, an associate in his compassion, his work of
salvation. There is something of a divine plea in this mission, and only after
long debate does Moses attune his own will to that of the Savior God. But in
the dialogue in which God confides in him, Moses also learns how to pray: he
balks, makes excuses, above all questions: and it is in response to his question
that the Lord confides his ineffable name, which will be revealed through his
mighty deeds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2576
&quot;Thus the Lord used to speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his
friend.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2KR href="__P91.HTM#$2KR">21</a></sup></font> Moses' prayer is characteristic of contemplative prayer
by which God's servant remains faithful to his mission. Moses converses with
God often and at length, climbing the mountain to hear and entreat him and
coming down to the people to repeat the words of his God for their guidance.
Moses &quot;is entrusted with all my house. With him I speak face to face,
clearly, not in riddles,&quot; for &quot;Moses was very humble, more so than
anyone else on the face of the earth.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2KS href="__P91.HTM#$2KS">22</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2577
From this intimacy with the faithful God, slow to anger and abounding in
steadfast love,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2KT href="__P91.HTM#$2KT">23</a></sup></font> Moses drew strength and determination for his
intercession. He does not pray for himself but for the people whom God made his
own. Moses already intercedes for them during the battle with the Amalekites
and prays to obtain healing for Miriam.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2KU href="__P91.HTM#$2KU">24</a></sup></font> But it is chiefly after their
apostasy that Moses &quot;stands in the breach&quot; before God in order to
save the people.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2KV href="__P91.HTM#$2KV">25</a></sup></font> The arguments of his prayer - for intercession is
also a mysterious battle - will inspire the boldness of the great intercessors
among the Jewish people and in the Church: God is love; he is therefore
righteous and faithful; he cannot contradict himself; he must remember his
marvellous deeds, since his glory is at stake, and he cannot forsake this
people that bears his name.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>David and
the prayer of the king</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2578
The prayer of the People of God flourishes in the shadow of God's dwelling
place, first the ark of the covenant and later the Temple. At first the leaders
of the people - the shepherds and the prophets - teach them to pray. the infant
Samuel must have learned from his mother Hannah how &quot;to stand before the
LORD&quot; and from the priest Eli how to listen to his word: &quot;Speak,
LORD, for your servant is listening.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2KW href="__P91.HTM#$2KW">26</a></sup></font> Later, he will also know
the cost and consequence of intercession: &quot;Moreover, as for me, far be it
from me that I should sin against the LORD by ceasing to pray for you; and I
will instruct you in the good and the right way.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2KX href="__P91.HTM#$2KX">27</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2579
David is par excellence the king &quot;after God's own heart,&quot; the
shepherd who prays for his people and prays in their name. His submission to
the will of God, his praise, and his repentance, will be a model for the prayer
of the people. His prayer, the prayer of God's Anointed, is a faithful
adherence to the divine promise and expresses a loving and joyful trust in God,
the only King and Lord.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2KY href="__P91.HTM#$2KY">28</a></sup></font> In the Psalms David, inspired by the Holy
Spirit, is the first prophet of Jewish and Christian prayer. the prayer of
Christ, the true Messiah and Son of David, will reveal and fulfill the meaning
of this prayer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2580
The Temple of Jerusalem, the house of prayer that David wanted to build, will
be the work of his son, Solomon. the prayer at the dedication of the Temple
relies on God's promise and covenant, on the active presence of his name among
his People, recalling his mighty deeds at the Exodus.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2KZ href="__P91.HTM#$2KZ">29</a></sup></font> The king lifts
his hands toward heaven and begs the Lord, on his own behalf, on behalf of the
entire people, and of the generations yet to come, for the forgiveness of their
sins and for their daily needs, so that the nations may know that He is the
only God and that the heart of his people may belong wholly and entirely to
him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Elijah, the
prophets and conversion of heart</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2581
For the People of God, the Temple was to be the place of their education in
prayer: pilgrimages, feasts and sacrifices, the evening offering, the incense,
and the bread of the Presence (&ldquo;shewbread&quot;) - all these signs of the
holiness and glory of God Most High and Most Near were appeals to and ways of
prayer. But ritualism often encouraged an excessively external worship. the
people needed education in faith and conversion of heart; this was the mission
of the prophets, both before and after the Exile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2582
Elijah is the &quot;father&quot; of the prophets, &quot;the generation of those
who seek him, who seek the face of the God of Jacob.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2L0 href="__P91.HTM#$2L0">30</a></sup></font> Elijah's
name, &quot;The Lord is my God,&quot; foretells the people's cry in response to
his prayer on Mount Carmel.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2L1 href="__P91.HTM#$2L1">31</a></sup></font> St. James refers to Elijah in order to
encourage us to pray: &quot;The prayer of the righteous is powerful and
effective.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2L2 href="__P91.HTM#$2L2">32</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2583
After Elijah had learned mercy during his retreat at the Wadi Cherith, he
teaches the widow of Zarephath to believe in the Word of God and confirms her
faith by his urgent prayer: God brings the widow's child back to
life.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2L3 href="__P91.HTM#$2L3">33</a></sup></font> The sacrifice on Mount Carmel is a decisive test for the faith
of the People of God. In response to Elijah's plea, &quot;Answer me, O LORD,
answer me,&quot; the Lord's fire consumes the holocaust, at the time of the
evening oblation. the Eastern liturgies repeat Elijah's plea in the Eucharistic
epiclesis. <br>
Finally, taking the desert road that leads to the place where the living and
true God reveals himself to his people, Elijah, like Moses before him, hides
&quot;in a cleft of he rock&quot; until the mysterious presence of God has
passed by.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2L4 href="__P91.HTM#$2L4">34</a></sup></font> But only on the mountain of the Transfiguration will Moses
and Elijah behold the unveiled face of him whom they sought; &quot;the light of
the knowledge of the glory of God [shines] in the face of Christ,&quot;
crucified and risen.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2L5 href="__P91.HTM#$2L5">35</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2584
In their &quot;one to one&quot; encounters with God, the prophets draw light
and strength for their mission. Their prayer is not flight from this unfaithful
world, but rather attentiveness to the Word of God. At times their prayer is an
argument or a complaint, but it is always an intercession that awaits and
prepares for the intervention of the Savior God, the Lord of history.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2L6 href="__P91.HTM#$2L6">36</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Psalms,
the prayer of the assembly</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2585
From the time of David to the coming of the Messiah texts appearing in these
sacred books show a deepening in prayer for oneself and in prayer for
others.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2L7 href="__P91.HTM#$2L7">37</a></sup></font> Thus the psalms were gradually collected into the five books
of the Psalter (or &quot;Praises&quot;), the masterwork of prayer in the Old
Testament.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2586
The Psalms both nourished and expressed the prayer of the People of God
gathered during the great feasts at Jerusalem and each Sabbath in the
synagogues. Their prayer is inseparably personal and communal; it concerns both
those who are praying and all men. the Psalms arose from the communities of the
Holy Land and the Diaspora, but embrace all creation. Their prayer recalls the
saving events of the past, yet extends into the future, even to the end of
history; it commemorates the promises God has already kept, and awaits the Messiah
who will fulfill them definitively. Prayed by Christ and fulfilled in him, the
Psalms remain essential to the prayer of the Church.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2L8 href="__P91.HTM#$2L8">38</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2587
The Psalter is the book in which the Word of God becomes man's prayer. In other
books of the Old Testament, &quot;the words proclaim [God's] works and bring to
light the mystery they contain.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2L9 href="__P91.HTM#$2L9">39</a></sup></font> The words of the Psalmist, sung
for God, both express and acclaim the Lord's saving works; the same Spirit
inspires both God's work and man's response. Christ will unite the two. In him,
the psalms continue to teach us how to pray.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2588
The Psalter's many forms of prayer take shape both in the liturgy of the Temple
and in the human heart. Whether hymns or prayers of lamentation or
thanksgiving, whether individual or communal, whether royal chants, songs of
pilgrimage or wisdom meditations, the Psalms are a mirror of God's marvelous
deeds in the history of his people, as well as reflections of the human
experiences of the Psalmist. Though a given psalm may reflect an event of the
past, it still possesses such direct simplicity that it can be prayed in truth
by men of all times and conditions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2589
Certain constant characteristics appear throughout the Psalms: simplicity and
spontaneity of prayer; the desire for God himself through and with all that is
good in his creation; the distraught situation of the believer who, in his
preferential love for the Lord, is exposed to a host of enemies and
temptations, but who waits upon what the faithful God will do, in the certitude
of his love and in submission to his will. the prayer of the psalms is always
sustained by praise; that is why the title of this collection as handed down to
us is so fitting: &quot;The Praises.&quot; Collected for the assembly's
worship, the Psalter both sounds the call to prayer and sings the response to
that call: Hallelu-Yah! (&ldquo;Alleluia&quot;), &quot;Praise the Lord!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>What is more pleasing than a
psalm? David expresses it well: &quot;Praise the Lord, for a psalm is good: let
there be praise of our God with gladness and grace!&quot; Yes, a psalm is a
blessing on the lips of the people, praise of God, the assembly's homage, a
general acclamation, a word that speaks for all, the voice of the Church, a
confession of faith in song.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2LA href="__P91.HTM#$2LA">40</a></sup></font></p>
