<p class=MsoNormal>I. NAMES
AND IMAGES OF THE CHURCH</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>751
The word &quot;Church&quot; (Latin ecclesia, from the Greek ek-ka-lein, to
&quot;call out of&quot;) means a convocation or an assembly. It designates the
assemblies of the people, usually for a religious purpose.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-YY href="__P27.HTM#$YY">139</a></sup></font> Ekklesia
is used frequently in the Greek Old Testament for the assembly of the Chosen
People before God, above all for their assembly on Mount Sinai where Israel
received the Law and was established by God as his holy people.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-YZ href="__P27.HTM#$YZ">140</a></sup></font> By
calling itself &quot;Church,&quot; the first community of Christian believers
recognized itself as heir to that assembly. In the Church, God is &quot;calling
together&quot; his people from all the ends of the earth. the equivalent Greek
term Kyriake, from which the English word Church and the German Kirche are
derived, means &quot;what belongs to the Lord.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>752
In Christian usage, the word &quot;church&quot; designates the liturgical
assembly,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-Z0 href="__P27.HTM#$Z0">141</a></sup></font> but also the local community<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-Z1 href="__P27.HTM#$Z1">142</a></sup></font> or the whole
universal community of believers.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-Z2 href="__P27.HTM#$Z2">143</a></sup></font> These three meanings are
inseparable. &quot;The Church&quot; is the People that God gathers in the whole
world. She exists in local communities and is made real as a liturgical, above
all a Eucharistic, assembly. She draws her life from the word and the Body of
Christ and so herself becomes Christ's Body.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Symbols of
the Church</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>753
In Scripture, we find a host of interrelated images and figures through which
Revelation speaks of the inexhaustible mystery of the Church. the images taken
from the Old Testament are variations on a profound theme: the People of God.
In the New Testament, all these images find a new center because Christ has
become the head of this people, which henceforth is his Body.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-Z3 href="__P27.HTM#$Z3">144</a></sup></font> Around
this center are grouped images taken &quot;from the life of the shepherd or
from cultivation of the land, from the art of building or from family life and
marriage.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-Z4 href="__P27.HTM#$Z4">145</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>754
&quot;The
Church is, accordingly, a sheepfold, the sole and necessary gateway to which is
Christ. It is also the flock of which God himself foretold that he would be the
shepherd, and whose sheep, even though governed by human shepherds, are
unfailingly nourished and led by Christ himself, the Good Shepherd and Prince
of Shepherds, who gave his life for his sheep.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-Z5 href="__P27.HTM#$Z5">146</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>755
&quot;The
Church is a cultivated field, the tillage of God. On that land the ancient
olive tree grows whose holy roots were the prophets and in which the
reconciliation of Jews and Gentiles has been brought about and will be brought
about again. That land, like a choice vineyard, has been planted by the
heavenly cultivator. Yet the true vine is Christ who gives life and
fruitfulness to the branches, that is, to us, who through the Church remain in
Christ, without whom we can do nothing.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-Z6 href="__P27.HTM#$Z6">147</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>756
&quot;Often,
too, the Church is called the building of God. the Lord compared himself to the
stone which the builders rejected, but which was made into the comer-stone. On
this foundation the Church is built by the apostles and from it the Church
receives solidity and unity. This edifice has many names to describe it: the
house of God in which his family dwells; the household of God in the Spirit;
the dwelling-place of God among men; and, especially, the holy temple. This
temple, symbolized in places of worship built out of stone, is praised by the
Fathers and, not without reason, is compared in the liturgy to the Holy City,
the New Jerusalem. As living stones we here on earth are built into it. It is
this holy city that is seen by John as it comes down out of heaven from God
when the world is made anew, prepared like a bride adorned for her husband.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-Z7 href="__P27.HTM#$Z7">148</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>757
&quot;The
Church, further, which is called 'that Jerusalem which is above' and 'our
mother', is described as the spotless spouse of the spotless lamb. It is she
whom Christ 'loved and for whom he delivered himself up that he might sanctify
her.' It is she whom he unites to himself by an unbreakable alliance, and whom
he constantly 'nourishes and cherishes.'&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-Z8 href="__P27.HTM#$Z8">149</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>II. THE
CHURCH'S ORIGIN, FOUNDATION AND MISSION</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>758
We begin our investigation of the Church's mystery by meditating on her origin
in the Holy Trinity's plan and her progressive realization in history.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A plan born
in the Father's heart</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>759
&quot;The eternal Father, in accordance with the utterly gratuitous and
mysterious design of his wisdom and goodness, created the whole universe and
chose to raise up men to share in his own divine life,&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-Z9 href="__P27.HTM#$Z9">150</a></sup></font> to
which he calls all men in his Son. &quot;The Father . . . determined to call
together in a holy Church those who should believe in Christ.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-ZA href="__P27.HTM#$ZA">151</a></sup></font>
This &quot;family of God&quot; is gradually formed and takes shape during the
stages of human history, in keeping with the Father's plan. In fact,
&quot;already present in figure at the beginning of the world, this Church was
prepared in marvellous fashion in the history of the people of Israel and the
old Advance. Established in this last age of the world and made manifest in the
outpouring of the Spirit, it will be brought to glorious completion at the end
of time.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-ZB href="__P27.HTM#$ZB">152</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Church
- foreshadowed from the world's beginning</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>760
Christians of the first centuries said, &quot;The world was created for the
sake of the Church.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-ZC href="__P27.HTM#$ZC">153</a></sup></font> God created the world for the sake of
communion with his divine life, a communion brought about by the &quot;convocation&quot;
of men in Christ, and this &quot;convocation&quot; is the Church. the Church is
the goal of all things,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-ZD href="__P27.HTM#$ZD">154</a></sup></font> and God permitted such painful upheavals as
the angels' fall and man's sin only as occasions and means for displaying all
the power of his arm and the whole measure of the love he wanted to give the
world:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>Just as God's will is creation
and is called &quot;the world,&quot; so his intention is the salvation of men,
and it is called &quot;the Church.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-ZE href="__P27.HTM#$ZE">155</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Church
- prepared for in the Old Covenant</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>761
The gathering together of the People of God began at the moment when sin
destroyed the communion of men with God, and that of men among themselves. the
gathering together of the Church is, as it were, God's reaction to the chaos
provoked by sin. This reunification is achieved secretly in the heart of all
peoples: &quot;In every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is
acceptable&quot; to God.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-ZF href="__P27.HTM#$ZF">156</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>762
The remote preparation for this gathering together of the People of God begins
when he calls Abraham and promises that he will become the father of a great
people.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-ZG href="__P27.HTM#$ZG">157</a></sup></font> Its immediate preparation begins with Israel's election as
the People of God. By this election, Israel is to be the sign of the future gathering
of All nations.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-ZH href="__P27.HTM#$ZH">158</a></sup></font> But the prophets accuse Israel of breaking the
covenant and behaving like a prostitute. They announce a new and eternal
covenant. &quot;Christ instituted this New Covenant.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-ZI href="__P27.HTM#$ZI">159</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Church
- instituted by Christ Jesus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>763
It was the Son's task to accomplish the Father's plan of salvation in the
fullness of time. Its accomplishment was the reason for his being
sent.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-ZJ href="__P27.HTM#$ZJ">160</a></sup></font> &quot;The Lord Jesus inaugurated his Church by preaching the
Good News, that is, the coming of the Reign of God, promised over the ages in
the scriptures.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-ZK href="__P27.HTM#$ZK">161</a></sup></font> To fulfill the Father's will, Christ ushered
in the Kingdom of heaven on earth. the Church &quot;is the Reign of Christ
already present in mystery.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-ZL href="__P27.HTM#$ZL">162</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>764
&quot;This Kingdom shines out before men in the word, in the works and in the
presence of Christ.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-ZM href="__P27.HTM#$ZM">163</a></sup></font> To welcome Jesus' word is to welcome
&quot;the Kingdom itself.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-ZN href="__P27.HTM#$ZN">164</a></sup></font> The seed and beginning of the
Kingdom are the &quot;little flock&quot; of those whom Jesus came to gather
around him, the flock whose shepherd he is.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-ZO href="__P27.HTM#$ZO">165</a></sup></font> They form Jesus' true
family.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-ZP href="__P27.HTM#$ZP">166</a></sup></font> To those whom he thus gathered around him, he taught a new
&quot;way of acting&quot; and a prayer of their own.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-ZQ href="__P27.HTM#$ZQ">167</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>765
The Lord Jesus endowed his community with a structure that will remain until
the Kingdom is fully achieved. Before all else there is the choice of the
Twelve with Peter as their head.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-ZR href="__P27.HTM#$ZR">168</a></sup></font> Representing the twelve tribes of
Israel, they are the foundation stones of the new Jerusalem.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-ZS href="__P27.HTM#$ZS">169</a></sup></font> The
Twelve and the other disciples share in Christ's mission and his power, but
also in his lot.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-ZT href="__P27.HTM#$ZT">170</a></sup></font> By all his actions, Christ prepares and builds his
Church.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>766
The Church is born primarily of Christ's total self-giving for our salvation,
anticipated in the institution of the Eucharist and fulfilled on the cross.
&quot;The origin and growth of the Church are symbolized by the blood and water
which flowed from the open side of the crucified Jesus.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-ZU href="__P27.HTM#$ZU">171</a></sup></font>
&quot;For it was from the side of Christ as he slept the sleep of death upon
the cross that there came forth the 'wondrous sacrament of the whole
Church.'&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-ZV href="__P27.HTM#$ZV">172</a></sup></font> As Eve was formed from the sleeping Adam's side, so
the Church was born from the pierced heart of Christ hanging dead on the
cross.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-ZW href="__P27.HTM#$ZW">173</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Church
- revealed by the Holy Spirit</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>767
&quot;When the work which the Father gave the Son to do on earth was
accomplished, the Holy Spirit was sent on the day of Pentecost in order that he
might continually sanctify the Church.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-ZX href="__P27.HTM#$ZX">174</a></sup></font> Then &quot;the Church
was openly displayed to the crowds and the spread of the Gospel among the
nations, through preaching, was begun.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-ZY href="__P27.HTM#$ZY">175</a></sup></font> As the
&quot;convocation&quot; of all men for salvation, the Church in her very nature
is missionary, sent by Christ to all the nations to make disciples of
them.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-ZZ href="__P27.HTM#$ZZ">176</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>768
So that she can fulfill her mission, the Holy Spirit &quot;bestows upon [the
Church] varied hierarchic and charismatic gifts, and in this way directs
her.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-100 href="__P27.HTM#$100">177</a></sup></font> &quot;Henceforward the Church, endowed with the gifts of
her founder and faithfully observing his precepts of charity, humility and
self-denial, receives the mission of proclaiming and establishing among all peoples
the Kingdom of Christ and of God, and she is on earth the seed and the
beginning of that kingdom.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-101 href="__P27.HTM#$101">178</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Church
- perfected in glory</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>769
&quot;The Church . . . will receive its perfection only in the glory of
heaven,&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-102 href="__P27.HTM#$102">179</a></sup></font> at the time of Christ's glorious return. Until that
day, &quot;the Church progresses on her pilgrimage amidst this world's
persecutions and God's consolations.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-103 href="__P27.HTM#$103">180</a></sup></font> Here below she knows that
she is in exile far from the Lord, and longs for the full coming of the Kingdom,
when she will &quot;be united in glory with her king.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-104 href="__P27.HTM#$104">181</a></sup></font> The
Church, and through her the world, will not be perfected in glory without great
trials. Only then will &quot;all the just from the time of Adam, 'from Abel,
the just one, to the last of the elect,' . . . be gathered together in the
universal Church in the Father's presence.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-105 href="__P27.HTM#$105">182</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>III. THE
MYSTERY OF THE CHURCH</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>770
The Church is in history, but at the same time she transcends it. It is only
&quot;with the eyes of faith&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-106 href="__P27.HTM#$106">183</a></sup></font> that one can see her in her
visible reality and at the same time in her spiritual reality as bearer of
divine life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Church
- both visible and spiritual</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>771
&quot;The one mediator, Christ, established and ever sustains here on earth his
holy Church, the community of faith, hope, and charity, as a visible
organization through which he communicates truth and grace to all
men.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-107 href="__P27.HTM#$107">184</a></sup></font> The Church is at the same time: <br>
- a &quot;society structured with hierarchical organs and the mystical body of
Christ; <br>
- the visible society and the spiritual community; <br>
- the earthly Church and the Church endowed with heavenly
riches.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-108 href="__P27.HTM#$108">185</a></sup></font> <br>
These dimensions together constitute &quot;one complex reality which comes
together from a human and a divine element&quot;:<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-109 href="__P27.HTM#$109">186</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>The Church is essentially both
human and divine, visible but endowed with invisible realities, zealous in
action and dedicated to contemplation, present in the world, but as a pilgrim,
so constituted that in her the human is directed toward and subordinated to the
divine, the visible to the invisible, action to contemplation, and this present
world to that city yet to come, the object of our quest.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-10A href="__P27.HTM#$10A">187</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>O
humility! O sublimity! Both tabernacle of cedar and sanctuary of God; earthly
dwelling and celestial palace; house of clay and royal hall; body of death and
temple of light; and at last both object of scorn to the proud and bride of
Christ! She is black but beautiful, O daughters of Jerusalem, for even if the
labor and pain of her long exile may have discolored her, yet heaven's beauty
has adorned her.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-10B href="__P27.HTM#$10B">188</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Church
- mystery of men's union with God</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>772
It is in the Church that Christ fulfills and reveals his own mystery as the
purpose of God's plan: &quot;to unite all things in him.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-10C href="__P27.HTM#$10C">189</a></sup></font> St.
Paul calls the nuptial union of Christ and the Church &quot;a great
mystery.&quot; Because she is united to Christ as to her bridegroom, she
becomes a mystery in her turn.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-10D href="__P27.HTM#$10D">190</a></sup></font> Contemplating this mystery in her,
Paul exclaims: &quot;Christ in you, the hope of glory.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-10E href="__P27.HTM#$10E">191</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>773
In the Church this communion of men with God, in the &quot;love [that] never
ends,&quot; is the purpose which governs everything in her that is a
sacramental means, tied to this passing world.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-10F href="__P27.HTM#$10F">192</a></sup></font> <br>
&quot;[The Church's] structure is totally ordered to the holiness of Christ's
members. and holiness is measured according to the 'great mystery' in which the
Bride responds with the gift of love to the gift of the
Bridegroom.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-10G href="__P27.HTM#$10G">193</a></sup></font> Mary goes before us all in the holiness that is
the Church's mystery as &quot;the bride without spot or
wrinkle.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-10H href="__P27.HTM#$10H">194</a></sup></font> This is why the &quot;Marian&quot; dimension of the
Church precedes the &quot;Petrine.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-10I href="__P27.HTM#$10I">195</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The
universal Sacrament of Salvation</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>774
The
Greek word mysterion was translated into Latin by two terms: mystenum and
sacramentum. In later usage the term sacramentum emphasizes the visible sign of
the hidden reality of salvation which was indicated by the term mystenum. In
this sense, Christ himself is the mystery of salvation: &quot;For there is no
other mystery of God, except Christ.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-10J href="__P27.HTM#$10J">196</a></sup></font> The saving work of his
holy and sanctifying humanity is the sacrament of salvation, which is revealed
and active in the Church's sacraments (which the Eastern Churches also call
&quot;the holy mysteries&quot;). the seven sacraments are the signs and
instruments by which the Holy Spirit spreads the grace of Christ the head
throughout the Church which is his Body. the Church, then, both contains and
communicates the invisible grace she signifies. It is in this analogical sense,
that the Church is called a &quot;sacrament.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>775
&quot;The Church, in Christ, is like a sacrament - a sign and instrument, that
is, of communion with God and of unity among all men.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-10K href="__P27.HTM#$10K">197</a></sup></font> The
Church's first purpose is to be the sacrament of the inner union of men with
God. Because men's communion with one another is rooted in that union with God,
the Church is also the sacrament of the unity of the human race. In her, this
unity is already begun, since she gathers men &quot;from every nation, from all
tribes and peoples and tongues&quot;;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-10L href="__P27.HTM#$10L">198</a></sup></font> at the same time, the Church
is the &quot;sign and instrument&quot; of the full realization of the unity yet
to come.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>776
As sacrament, the Church is Christ's instrument. &quot;She is taken up by him
also as the instrument for the salvation of all,&quot; &quot;the universal
sacrament of salvation,&quot; by which Christ is &quot;at once manifesting and
actualizing the mystery of God's love for men.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-10M href="__P27.HTM#$10M">199</a></sup></font> The Church
&quot;is the visible plan of God's love for humanity,&quot; because God desires
&quot;that the whole human race may become one People of God, form one Body of
Christ, and be built up into one temple of the Holy Spirit.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-10N href="__P27.HTM#$10N">200</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>IN BRIEF</p>

&quot;Church&quot; means &quot;convocation.&quot; It designates the assembly of
those whom God's Word &quot;convokes,&quot; i.e., gathers together to form the
People of God, and who themselves, nourished with the Body of Christ, become
the Body of Christ.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>778 The Church is both the
means and the goal of God's plan: prefigured in creation, prepared for in the
Old Covenant, founded by the words and actions of Jesus Christ, fulfilled by
his redeeming cross and his Resurrection, the Church has been manifested as the
mystery of salvation by the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. She will be
perfected in the glory of heaven as the assembly of all the redeemed of the
earth (cf Rev 14:4).</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>779 The Church is both
visible and spiritual, a hierarchical society and the Mystical Body of Christ.
She is one, yet formed of two components, human and divine. That is her
mystery, which only faith can accept.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>780 The Church in this world
is the sacrament of salvation, the sign and the instrument of the communion of
God and men.</i></p>
