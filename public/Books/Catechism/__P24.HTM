<p class=MsoNormal>Pentecost</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>731
On the day of Pentecost when the seven weeks of Easter had come to an end, Christ's
Passover is fulfilled in the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, manifested, given,
and communicated as a divine person: of his fullness, Christ, the Lord, pours
out the Spirit in abundance.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-YH href="__P24.HTM#$YH">122</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>732
On that day, the Holy Trinity is fully revealed. Since that day, the Kingdom
announced by Christ has been open to those who believe in him: in the humility
of the flesh and in faith, they already share in the communion of the Holy
Trinity. By his coming, which never ceases, the Holy Spirit causes the world to
enter into the &quot;last days,&quot; the time of the Church, the Kingdom
already inherited though not yet consummated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>We have seen the true Light,
we have received the heavenly Spirit, we have found the true faith: we adore
the indivisible Trinity, who has saved us.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-YI href="__P24.HTM#$YI">123</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Holy
Spirit - God's gift</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>733
&quot;God is Love&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-YJ href="__P24.HTM#$YJ">124</a></sup></font> and love is his first gift, containing all
others. &quot;God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy
Spirit who has been given to us.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-YK href="__P24.HTM#$YK">125</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>734
Because we are dead or at least wounded through sin, the first effect of the
gift of love is the forgiveness of our sins. the communion of the Holy
Spirit<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-YL href="__P24.HTM#$YL">126</a></sup></font> in the Church restores to the baptized the divine likeness
lost through sin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>735
He, then, gives us the &quot;pledge&quot; or &quot;first fruits&quot; of our
inheritance: the very life of the Holy Trinity, which is to love as &quot;God
(has) loved us.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-YM href="__P24.HTM#$YM">127</a></sup></font> This love (the &quot;charity&quot; of 1
Cor 13) is the source of the new life in Christ, made possible
because we have received &quot;power&quot; from the Holy Spirit.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-YN href="__P24.HTM#$YN">128</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>736
By this power of the Spirit, God's children can bear much fruit. He who has
grafted us onto the true vine will make us bear &quot;the fruit of the Spirit:
. . . love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness,
self-control.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-YO href="__P24.HTM#$YO">129</a></sup></font> &quot;We live by the Spirit&quot;; the more we
renounce ourselves, the more we &quot;walk by the Spirit.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-YP href="__P24.HTM#$YP">130</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>Through the Holy Spirit we are
restored to paradise, led back to the Kingdom of heaven, and adopted as
children, given confidence to call God &quot;Father&quot; and to share in
Christ's grace, called children of light and given a share in eternal glory.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-YQ href="__P24.HTM#$YQ">131</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Holy
Spirit and the Church</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>737
The mission of Christ and the Holy Spirit is brought to completion in the
Church, which is the Body of Christ and the Temple of the Holy Spirit. This
joint mission henceforth brings Christ's faithful to share in his communion
with the Father in the Holy Spirit. the Spirit prepares men and goes out to
them with his grace, in order to draw them to Christ. the Spirit manifests the
risen Lord to them, recalls his word to them and opens their minds to the
understanding of his Death and Resurrection. He makes present the mystery of
Christ, supremely in the Eucharist, in order to reconcile them, to bring them
into communion with God, that they may &quot;bear much fruit.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-YR href="__P24.HTM#$YR">132</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>738
Thus the Church's mission is not an addition to that of Christ and the Holy
Spirit, but is its sacrament: in her whole being and in all her members, the
Church is sent to announce, bear witness, make present, and spread the mystery
of the communion of the Holy Trinity (the topic of the next article):</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>All of us who have received
one and the same Spirit, that is, the Holy Spirit, are in a sense blended
together with one another and with God. For if Christ, together with the
Father's and his own Spirit, comes to dwell in each of us, though we are many,
still the Spirit is one and undivided. He binds together the spirits of each
and every one of us, . . . and makes all appear as one in him. For just as the
power of Christ's sacred flesh unites those in whom it dwells into one body, I
think that in the same way the one and undivided Spirit of God, who dwells in
all, leads all into spiritual unity.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-YS href="__P24.HTM#$YS">133</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>739
Because the Holy Spirit is the anointing of Christ, it is Christ who, as the
head of the Body, pours out the Spirit among his members to nourish, heal, and
organize them in their mutual functions, to give them life, send them to bear
witness, and associate them to his self-offering to the Father and to his
intercession for the whole world. Through the Church's sacraments, Christ
communicates his Holy and sanctifying Spirit to the members of his Body. (This
will be the topic of Part Two of the Catechism.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>740
These &quot;mighty works of God,&quot; offered to believers in the sacraments
of the Church, bear their fruit in the new life in Christ, according to the
Spirit. (This will be the topic of Part Three.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>741
&quot;The Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we
ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes with sighs too deep for
words.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-YT href="__P24.HTM#$YT">134</a></sup></font> The Holy Spirit, the artisan of God's works, is the
master of prayer. (This will be the topic of Part Four.)</p>
