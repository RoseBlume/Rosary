<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>THE TEN COMMANDMENTS</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Teacher,
what must I do . . .?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2052
&quot;Teacher, what good deed must I do, to have eternal life?&quot; To the
young man who asked this question,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus
answers first by invoking the necessity to recognize God as the &quot;One there
is who is good,&quot; as the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>supreme
Good and the source of all good. Then Jesus tells him: &quot;If you would enter
life, keep the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>commandments.&quot;
and he cites for his questioner the precepts that concern love of neighbor:
&quot;You shall not</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>kill, You
shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false
witness, Honor your father</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and
mother.&quot; Finally Jesus sums up these commandments positively: &quot;You
shall love your neighbor as</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>yourself.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-25U href="__P78.HTM#$25U">1</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2053
To this first reply Jesus adds a second: &quot;If you would be perfect, go,
sell what you possess and give to the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>poor, and
you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-25V href="__P78.HTM#$25V">2</a></sup></font> This
reply does not do away with the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>first:
following Jesus Christ involves keeping the Commandments. the Law has not been
abolished,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-25W href="__P78.HTM#$25W">3</a></sup></font> but</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>rather man
is invited to rediscover it in the person of his Master who is its perfect
fulfillment. In the three</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>synoptic
Gospels, Jesus' call to the rich young man to follow him, in the obedience of a
disciple and in the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>observance
of the Commandments, is joined to the call to poverty and chastity.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-25X href="__P78.HTM#$25X">4</a></sup></font>
The evangelical counsels</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>are
inseparable from the Commandments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2054
Jesus acknowledged the Ten Commandments, but he also showed the power of the
Spirit at work in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>their
letter. He preached a &quot;righteousness [which] exceeds that of the scribes
and Pharisees&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-25Y href="__P78.HTM#$25Y">5</a></sup></font> as well as that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of the
Gentiles.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-25Z href="__P78.HTM#$25Z">6</a></sup></font> He unfolded all the demands of the Commandments. &quot;You
have heard that it was said to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the men of
old, 'You shall not kill.' . . . But I say to you that every one who is angry
with his brother shall be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>liable to
judgment.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-260 href="__P78.HTM#$260">7</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2055
When someone asks him, &quot;Which commandment in the Law is the
greatest?&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-261 href="__P78.HTM#$261">8</a></sup></font> Jesus replies: &quot;You</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>shall love
the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all
your mind. This is the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>greatest
and first commandment. and a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as
yourself. On these</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>two
commandments hang all the Law and the prophets.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-262 href="__P78.HTM#$262">9</a></sup></font> The Decalogue
must be interpreted in light of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>this
twofold yet single commandment of love, the fullness of the Law:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>the commandments: &quot;You
shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill, You shall not steal, You shall
not covet,&quot; and any other commandment, are summed up in this sentence:
&quot;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&quot; Love does no wrong to a
neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-263 href="__P78.HTM#$263">10</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The
Decalogue in Sacred Scripture</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2056
The word &quot;Decalogue&quot; means literally &quot;ten words.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-264 href="__P78.HTM#$264">11</a></sup></font>
God revealed these &quot;ten words&quot; to his people</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>on the holy
mountain. They were written &quot;with the finger of God,&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-265 href="__P78.HTM#$265">12</a></sup></font>
unlike the other commandments</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>written by
Moses.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-266 href="__P78.HTM#$266">13</a></sup></font> They are pre-eminently the words of God. They are handed on to
us in the books of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Exodus
<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-267 href="__P78.HTM#$267">14</a></sup></font> and Deuteronomy.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-268 href="__P78.HTM#$268">15</a></sup></font> Beginning with the Old Testament, the
sacred books refer to the &quot;ten</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>words,&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-269 href="__P78.HTM#$269">16</a></sup></font>
but it is in the New Covenant in Jesus Christ that their full meaning will be
revealed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2057
The Decalogue must first be understood in the context of the Exodus, God's
great liberating event at</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the center
of the Old Covenant. Whether formulated as negative commandments, prohibitions,
or as</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>positive
precepts such as: &quot;Honor your father and mother,&quot; the &quot;ten
words&quot; point out the conditions of a life</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>freed from
the slavery of sin. the Decalogue is a path of life:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>If you love the LORD your God,
by walking in his ways, and by keeping his commandments and his statutes and
his ordinances, then you shall live andmultiply.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-26A href="__P78.HTM#$26A">17</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This
liberating power of the Decalogue appears, for example, in the commandment
about the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>sabbath
rest, directed also to foreigners and slaves:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>You shall remember that you
were a servant in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God brought you out
thence with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-26B href="__P78.HTM#$26B">18</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2058
The &quot;ten words&quot; sum up and proclaim God's law: &quot;These words the
Lord spoke to all your assembly at the mountain out of the midst of the fire,
the cloud, and the thick darkness, with a loud voice; and he added no more. and
he wrote them upon two tables of stone, and gave them to me.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-26C href="__P78.HTM#$26C">19</a></sup></font>
For this reason these two tables are called &quot;the Testimony.&quot; In fact,
they contain the terms of the covenant concluded between God and his people.
These &quot;tables of the Testimony&quot; were to be deposited in &quot;the
ark.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-26D href="__P78.HTM#$26D">20</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2059
The &quot;ten words&quot; are pronounced by God in the midst of a theophany
(&ldquo;The LORD spoke with you face to face at the mountain, out of the midst of the
fire.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-26E href="__P78.HTM#$26E">21</a></sup></font>). They belong to God's revelation of himself and his
glory. the gift of the Commandments is the gift of God himself and his holy
will. In making his will known, God reveals himself to his people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2060
The gift of the commandments and of the Law is part of the covenant God sealed
with his own. In Exodus, the revelation of the &quot;ten words&quot; is granted
between the proposal of the covenant <font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-26F href="__P78.HTM#$26F">22</a></sup></font> and its conclusion - after the
people had committed themselves to &quot;do&quot; all that the Lord had said,
and to &quot;obey&quot; it.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-26G href="__P78.HTM#$26G">23</a></sup></font> The Decalogue is never handed on without
first recalling the covenant (&ldquo;The LORD our God made</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>a covenant
with us in Horeb.&quot;).<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-26H href="__P78.HTM#$26H">24</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2061
The Commandments take on their full meaning within the covenant. According to
Scripture, man's</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>moral life
has all its meaning in and through the covenant. the first of the &quot;ten
words&quot; recalls that God loved</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>his people
first:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>Since there was a passing from
the paradise of freedom to the slavery of this world, in punishment for sin,
the first phrase of the Decalogue, the first word of God's commandments, bears
on freedom &quot;I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of
Egypt, out of the house of slavery.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-26I href="__P78.HTM#$26I">25</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2062
The Commandments properly so-called come in the second place: they express the
implications of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>belonging
to God through the establishment of the covenant. Moral existence is a response
to the Lord's</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>loving
initiative. It is the acknowledgement and homage given to God and a worship of
thanksgiving. It is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>cooperation
with the plan God pursues in history.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2063
The covenant and dialogue between God and man are also attested to by the fact
that all the obligations</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>are stated
in the first person (&ldquo;I am the Lord.&quot;) and addressed by God to another
personal subject (&ldquo;you&quot;). In</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>all God's
commandments, the singular personal pronoun designates the recipient. God makes
his will known</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to each person
in particular, at the same time as he makes it known to the whole people:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>The Lord prescribed love
towards God and taught justice towards neighbor, so that man would be neither
unjust, nor unworthy of God. Thus, through the Decalogue, God prepared man to
become his friend and to live in harmony with his neighbor.... the words of the
Decalogue remain likewise for us Christians. Far from being abolished, they
have received amplification and development from the fact of the coming of the
Lord in the flesh.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-26J href="__P78.HTM#$26J">26</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The
Decalogue in the Church's Tradition</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2064
In fidelity to Scripture and in conformity with the example of Jesus, the
tradition of the Church has</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>acknowledged
the primordial importance and significance of the Decalogue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2065
Ever
since St. Augustine, the Ten Commandments have occupied a predominant place in
the catechesis of baptismal candidates and the faithful. In the fifteenth
century, the custom arose of expressing the commandments of the Decalogue in rhymed
formulae, easy to memorize and in positive form. They are still in use today.
the catechisms of the Church have often expounded Christian morality by
following the order of the Ten Commandments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2066
The
division and numbering of the Commandments have varied in the course of
history. the present catechism follows the division of the Commandments
established by St. Augustine, which has become traditional in the Catholic
Church. It is also that of the Lutheran confessions. the Greek Fathers worked
out a slightly different division, which is found in the Orthodox Churches and
Reformed communities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2067
The Ten Commandments state what is required in the love of God and love of
neighbor. the first three concern love of God, and the other seven love of
neighbor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As charity comprises the two commandments to which the Lord related the
whole Law and the prophets . . . so the Ten Commandments were themselves given
on two tablets. Three were written on one tablet and seven on the
other.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-26K href="__P78.HTM#$26K">27</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2068
The Council of Trent teaches that the Ten Commandments are obligatory for
Christians and that the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>justified
man is still bound to keep them;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-26L href="__P78.HTM#$26L">28</a></sup></font> The Second Vatican Council confirms:
&quot;The bishops, successors</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of the
apostles, receive from the Lord . . . the mission of teaching all peoples, and
of preaching the Gospel to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>every
creature, so that all men may attain salvation through faith, Baptism and the
observance of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Commandments.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-26M href="__P78.HTM#$26M">29</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The unity
of the Decalogue</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2069
The Decalogue forms a coherent whole. Each &quot;word&quot; refers to each of
the others and to all of them; they</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reciprocally
condition one another. the two tables shed light on one another; they form an
organic unity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To
transgress one commandment is to infringe all the others.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-26N href="__P78.HTM#$26N">30</a></sup></font> One cannot
honor another person without</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>blessing
God his Creator. One cannot adore God without loving all men, his creatures.
the Decalogue brings</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>man's
religious and social life into unity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Decalogue
ant the natural law</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2070
The Ten Commandments belong to God's revelation. At the same time they teach us
the true humanity</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of man.
They bring to light the essential duties, and therefore, indirectly, the
fundamental rights inherent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in the
nature of the human person. the Decalogue contains a privileged expression of
the natural law:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>From the beginning, God had
implanted in the heart of man the precepts of the natural law. Then he was
content to remind him of them. This was the Decalogue.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-26O href="__P78.HTM#$26O">31</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2071
The commandments of the Decalogue, although accessible to reason alone, have
been revealed. To</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>attain a
complete and certain understanding of the requirements of the natural law,
sinful humanity needed</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>this revelation:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>A full explanation of the
commandments of the Decalogue became necessary in the state of sin because the
light of reason was obscured and the will had gone astray.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-26P href="__P78.HTM#$26P">32</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We know
God's commandments through the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>divine
revelation proposed to us in the Church, and through the voice of moral
conscience. the obligation</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of the
Decalogue</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2072
Since they express man's fundamental duties towards God and towards his
neighbor, the Ten</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Commandments
reveal, in their primordial content, grave obligations. They are fundamentally
immutable,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and they
oblige always and everywhere. No one can dispense from them. the Ten
Commandments are</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>engraved by
God in the human heart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2073
Obedience to the Commandments also implies obligations in matter which is, in
itself, light. Thus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>abusive
language is forbidden by the fifth commandment, but would be a grave offense
only as a result of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>circumstances
or the offender's intention. &quot;Apart from me you can do nothing&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2074
Jesus says: &quot;I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in me, and
I in him, he it is that bears</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>much fruit,
for apart from me you can do nothing.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-26Q href="__P78.HTM#$26Q">33</a></sup></font> The fruit referred to in
this saying is the holiness of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>a life made
fruitful by union with Christ. When we believe in Jesus Christ, partake of his
mysteries, and keep</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>his
commandments, the Savior himself comes to love, in us, his Father and his
brethren, our Father and our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>brethren.
His person becomes, through the Spirit, the living and interior rule of our
activity. &quot;This is my</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>commandment,
that you love one another as I have loved you.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-26R href="__P78.HTM#$26R">34</a></sup></font></p>
