<P class=MsoNormal><B style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">II. The </B><B 
style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Vocation to Chastity</B></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>2337 Chastity means the successful integration of sexuality 
within the person and thus the inner unity of man in his bodily and spiritual 
being. Sexuality, in which man's belonging to the bodily and biological world is 
expressed, becomes personal and truly human when it is integrated into the 
relationship of one person to another, in the complete and lifelong mutual gift 
of a man and a woman. <BR>The virtue of chastity therefore involves the 
integrity of the person and the integrality of the gift.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>The integrity of the person</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>2338 The chaste person maintains the integrity of the powers 
of life and love placed in him. This integrity ensures the unity of the person; 
it is opposed to any behavior that would impair it. It tolerates neither a 
double life nor duplicity in speech.<FONT face=Verdana size=2><SUP><A 
href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P85.HTM#$2DO" 
name=-2DO>124</A></SUP></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>2339 Chastity includes an apprenticeship in self-mastery 
which is a training in human freedom. the alternative is clear: either man 
governs his passions and finds peace, or he lets himself be dominated by them 
and becomes unhappy.<FONT face=Verdana size=2><SUP><A 
href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P85.HTM#$2DP" 
name=-2DP>125</A></SUP></FONT> "Man's dignity therefore requires him to act out 
of conscious and free choice, as moved and drawn in a personal way from within, 
and not by blind impulses in himself or by mere external constraint. Man gains 
such dignity when, ridding himself of all slavery to the passions, he presses 
forward to his goal by freely choosing what is good and, by his diligence and 
skill, effectively secures for himself the means suited to this end."<FONT 
face=Verdana size=2><SUP><A 
href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P85.HTM#$2DQ" 
name=-2DQ>126</A></SUP></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>2340 Whoever wants to remain faithful to his baptismal 
promises and resist temptations will want to adopt the means for doing so: 
self-knowledge, practice of an ascesis adapted to the situations that confront 
him, obedience to God's commandments, exercise of the moral virtues, and 
fidelity to prayer. "Indeed it is through chastity that we are gathered together 
and led back to the unity from which we were fragmented into multiplicity."<FONT 
face=Verdana size=2><SUP><A 
href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P85.HTM#$2DR" 
name=-2DR>127</A></SUP></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>2341 The virtue of chastity comes under the cardinal virtue 
of temperance, which seeks to permeate the passions and appetites of the senses 
with reason.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>2342 Self-mastery is a long and exacting work. One can never 
consider it acquired once and for all. It presupposes renewed effort at all 
stages of life.<FONT face=Verdana size=2><SUP><A 
href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P85.HTM#$2DS" 
name=-2DS>128</A></SUP></FONT> The effort required can be more intense in 
certain periods, such as when the personality is being formed during childhood 
and adolescence.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>2343 Chastity has laws of growth which progress through 
stages marked by imperfection and too often by sin. "Man . . . day by day builds 
himself up through his many free decisions; and so he knows, loves, and 
accomplishes moral good by stages of growth."<FONT face=Verdana size=2><SUP><A 
href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P85.HTM#$2DT" 
name=-2DT>129</A></SUP></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>2344 Chastity represents an eminently personal task; it also 
involves a cultural effort, for there is "an interdependence between personal 
betterment and the improvement of society."<FONT face=Verdana size=2><SUP><A 
href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P85.HTM#$2DU" 
name=-2DU>130</A></SUP></FONT> Chastity presupposes respect for the rights of 
the person, in particular the right to receive information and an education that 
respect the moral and spiritual dimensions of human life.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>2345 Chastity is a moral virtue. It is also a gift from God, 
a grace, a fruit of spiritual effort.<FONT face=Verdana size=2><SUP><A 
href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P85.HTM#$2DV" 
name=-2DV>131</A></SUP></FONT> The Holy Spirit enables one whom the water of 
Baptism has regenerated to imitate the purity of Christ.<FONT face=Verdana

name=-2DW>132</A></SUP></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>The integrality of the gift of self</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>2346 Charity is the form of all the virtues. Under its 
influence, chastity appears as a school of the gift of the person. Self-mastery 
is ordered to the gift of self. Chastity leads him who practices it to become a 
witness to his neighbor of God's fidelity and loving kindness.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>2347 The virtue of chastity blossoms in friendship. It shows 
the disciple how to follow and imitate him who has chosen us as his 
friends,<FONT face=Verdana size=2><SUP><A 
href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P85.HTM#$2DX" 
name=-2DX>133</A></SUP></FONT> who has given himself totally to us and allows us 
to participate in his divine estate. Chastity is a promise of immortality. 
<BR>Chastity is expressed notably in friendship with one's neighbor. Whether it 
develops between persons of the same or opposite sex, friendship represents a 
great good for all. It leads to spiritual communion.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>The various forms of chastity</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>2348 All the baptized are called to chastity. the Christian 
has "put on Christ,"<FONT face=Verdana size=2><SUP><A 
href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P85.HTM#$2DY" 
name=-2DY>134</A></SUP></FONT> The model for all chastity. All Christ's faithful 
are called to lead a chaste life in keeping with their particular states of 
life. At the moment of his Baptism, the Christian is pledged to lead his 
affective life in chastity.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>2349 "People should cultivate [chastity] in the way that is 
suited to their state of life. Some profess virginity or consecrated celibacy 
which enables them to give themselves to God alone with an undivided heart in a 
remarkable manner. Others live in the way prescribed for all by the moral law, 
whether they are married or single."<FONT face=Verdana size=2><SUP><A 
href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P85.HTM#$2DZ" 
name=-2DZ>135</A></SUP></FONT> Married people are called to live conjugal 
chastity; others practice chastity in continence:</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>There are three forms of the virtue of chastity: the first is 
that of spouses, the second that of widows, and the third that of virgins. We do 
not praise any one of them to the exclusion of the others.... This is what makes 
for the richness of the discipline of the Church.<FONT face=Verdana 
size=2><SUP><A href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P85.HTM#$2E0" 
name=-2E0>136</A></SUP></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>2350 Those who are engaged to marry are called to live 
chastity in continence. They should see in this time of testing a discovery of 
mutual respect, an apprenticeship in fidelity, and the hope of receiving one 
another from God. They should reserve for marriage the expressions of affection 
that belong to married love. They will help each other grow in chastity.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>Offenses against chastity</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>2351 Lust is disordered desire for or inordinate enjoyment of 
sexual pleasure. Sexual pleasure is morally disordered when sought for itself, 
isolated from its procreative and unitive purposes.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>2352 By masturbation is to be understood the deliberate 
stimulation of the genital organs in order to derive sexual pleasure. "Both the 
Magisterium of the Church, in the course of a constant tradition, and the moral 
sense of the faithful have been in no doubt and have firmly maintained that 
masturbation is an intrinsically and gravely disordered action."<FONT 
face=Verdana size=2><SUP><A 
href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P85.HTM#$2E1" 
name=-2E1>137</A></SUP></FONT> "The deliberate use of the sexual faculty, for 
whatever reason, outside of marriage is essentially contrary to its purpose." 
For here sexual pleasure is sought outside of "the sexual relationship which is 
demanded by the moral order and in which the total meaning of mutual self-giving 
and human procreation in the context of true love is achieved."<FONT 
face=Verdana size=2><SUP><A 
href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P85.HTM#$2E2" 
name=-2E2>138</A></SUP></FONT> <BR>To form an equitable judgment about the 
subjects' moral responsibility and to guide pastoral action, one must take into 
account the affective immaturity, force of acquired habit, conditions of 
anxiety, or other psychological or social factors that lessen or even extenuate 
moral culpability.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>2353 Fornication is carnal union between an unmarried man and 
an unmarried woman. It is gravely contrary to the dignity of persons and of 
human sexuality which is naturally ordered to the good of spouses and the 
generation and education of children. Moreover, it is a grave scandal when there 
is corruption of the young.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>2354 Pornography consists in removing real or simulated 
sexual acts from the intimacy of the partners, in order to display them 
deliberately to third parties. It offends against chastity because it perverts 
the conjugal act, the intimate giving of spouses to each other. It does grave 
injury to the dignity of its participants (actors, vendors, the public), since 
each one becomes an object of base pleasure and illicit profit for others. It 
immerses all who are involved in the illusion of a fantasy world. It is a grave 
offense. Civil authorities should prevent the production and distribution of 
pornographic materials.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>2355 Prostitution does injury to the dignity of the person 
who engages in it, reducing the person to an instrument of sexual pleasure. the 
one who pays sins gravely against himself: he violates the chastity to which his 
Baptism pledged him and defiles his body, the temple of the Holy Spirit.<FONT 
face=Verdana size=2><SUP><A 
href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P85.HTM#$2E3" 
name=-2E3>139</A></SUP></FONT> Prostitution is a social scourge. It usually 
involves women, but also men, children, and adolescents (The latter two cases 
involve the added sin of scandal.). While it is always gravely sinful to engage 
in prostitution, the imputability of the offense can be attenuated by 
destitution, blackmail, or social pressure.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>2356 Rape is the forcible violation of the sexual intimacy of 
another person. It does injury to justice and charity. Rape deeply wounds the 
respect, freedom, and physical and moral integrity to which every person has a 
right. It causes grave damage that can mark the victim for life. It is always an 
intrinsically evil act. Graver still is the rape of children committed by 
parents (incest) or those responsible for the education of the children 
entrusted to them.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>Chastity and homosexuality</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>2357 Homosexuality refers to relations between men or between 
women who experience an exclusive or predominant sexual attraction toward 
persons of the same sex. It has taken a great variety of forms through the 
centuries and in different cultures. Its psychological genesis remains largely 
unexplained. Basing itself on Sacred Scripture, which presents homosexual acts 
as acts of grave depravity,<FONT face=Verdana size=2><SUP><A 
href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P85.HTM#$2E4" 
name=-2E4>140</A></SUP></FONT> tradition has always declared that "homosexual 
acts are intrinsically disordered."<FONT face=Verdana size=2><SUP><A 
href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P85.HTM#$2E5" 
name=-2E5>141</A></SUP></FONT> They are contrary to the natural law. They close 
the sexual act to the gift of life. They do not proceed from a genuine affective 
and sexual complementarity. Under no circumstances can they be approved.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>2358 The number of men and women who have deep-seated homosexual 
tendencies is not negligible. This inclination, which is objectively disordered, 
constitutes for most of them a trial. They must be accepted with respect, compassion, 
and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided. 
These persons are called to fulfill God's will in their lives and, if they are Christians, 
to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord's Cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>2359 Homosexual persons are called to chastity. By the 
virtues of self-mastery that teach them inner freedom, at times by the support 
of disinterested friendship, by prayer and sacramental grace, they can and 
should gradually and resolutely approach Christian perfection.</P>
