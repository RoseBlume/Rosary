<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Paragraph 6. MARY - MOTHER OF CHRIST, MOTHER OF
THE CHURCH</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>963
Since the Virgin Mary's role in the mystery of Christ and the Spirit has been
treated, it is fitting now to consider her place in the mystery of the Church.
&quot;The Virgin Mary . . . is acknowledged and honored as being truly the
Mother of God and of the redeemer.... She is 'clearly the mother of the members
of Christ' ... since she has by her charity joined in bringing about the birth
of believers in the Church, who are members of its head.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-18Z href="__P2C.HTM#$18Z">500</a></sup></font>
&quot;Mary, Mother of Christ, Mother of the Church.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-190 href="__P2C.HTM#$190">501</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I. MARY'S
MOTHERHOOD WITH REGARD TO THE CHURCH</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wholly
united with her Son . . .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>964
Mary's role in the Church is inseparable from her union with Christ and flows
directly from it. &quot;This union of the mother with the Son in the work of
salvation is made manifest from the time of Christ's virginal conception up to
his death&quot;;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-191 href="__P2C.HTM#$191">502</a></sup></font> it is made manifest above all at the hour of his
Passion:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>Thus the Blessed Virgin
advanced in her pilgrimage of faith, and faithfully persevered in her union
with her Son unto the cross. There she stood, in keeping with the divine plan,
enduring with her only begotten Son the intensity of his suffering, joining
herself with his sacrifice in her mother's heart, and lovingly consenting to
the immolation of this victim, born of her: to be given, by the same Christ
Jesus dying on the cross, as a mother to his disciple, with these words:
&quot;Woman, behold your son.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-192 href="__P2C.HTM#$192">503</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>965
After her Son's Ascension, Mary &quot;aided the beginnings of the Church by her
prayers.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-193 href="__P2C.HTM#$193">504</a></sup></font> In her association with the apostles and several
women, &quot;we also see Mary by her prayers imploring the gift of the Spirit,
who had already overshadowed her in the Annunciation.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-194 href="__P2C.HTM#$194">505</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>. . . also
in her Assumption</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>966
&quot;Finally the Immaculate Virgin, preserved free from all stain of original
sin, when the course of her earthly life was finished, was taken up body and
soul into heavenly glory, and exalted by the Lord as Queen over all things, so
that she might be the more fully conformed to her Son, the Lord of lords and
conqueror of sin and death.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-195 href="__P2C.HTM#$195">506</a></sup></font> The Assumption of the Blessed
Virgin is a singular participation in her Son's Resurrection and an
anticipation of the resurrection of other Christians:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>In giving birth you kept your
virginity; in your Dormition you did not leave the world, O Mother of God, but
were joined to the source of Life. You conceived the living God and, by your
prayers, will deliver our souls from death.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-196 href="__P2C.HTM#$196">507</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>. . . she
is our Mother in the order of grace</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>967
By her complete adherence to the Father's will, to his Son's redemptive work,
and to every prompting of the Holy Spirit, the Virgin Mary is the Church's
model of faith and charity. Thus she is a &quot;preeminent and . . . wholly
unique member of the Church&quot;; indeed, she is the &quot;exemplary realization&quot;
(typus)<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-197 href="__P2C.HTM#$197">508</a></sup></font> of the Church.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>968
Her role in relation to the Church and to all humanity goes still further.
&quot;In a wholly singular way she cooperated by her obedience, faith, hope,
and burning charity in the Savior's work of restoring supernatural life to
souls. For this reason she is a mother to us in the order of
grace.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-198 href="__P2C.HTM#$198">509</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>969
&quot;This motherhood of Mary in the order of grace continues uninterruptedly
from the consent which she loyally gave at the Annunciation and which she
sustained without wavering beneath the cross, until the eternal fulfilment of
all the elect. Taken up to heaven she did not lay aside this saving office but
by her manifold intercession continues to bring us the gifts of eternal
salvation .... Therefore the Blessed Virgin is invoked in the Church under the
titles of Advocate, Helper, Benefactress, and Mediatrix.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-199 href="__P2C.HTM#$199">510</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>970
&quot;Mary's function as mother of men in no way obscures or diminishes this
unique mediation of Christ, but rather shows its power. But the Blessed
Virgin's salutary influence on men . . . flows forth from the superabundance of
the merits of Christ, rests on his mediation, depends entirely on it, and draws
all its power from it.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-19A href="__P2C.HTM#$19A">511</a></sup></font> &quot;No creature could ever be counted
along with the Incarnate Word and Redeemer; but just as the priesthood of
Christ is shared in various ways both by his ministers and the faithful, and as
the one goodness of God is radiated in different ways among his creatures, so
also the unique mediation of the Redeemer does not exclude but rather gives
rise to a manifold cooperation which is but a sharing in this one
source.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-19B href="__P2C.HTM#$19B">512</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>II.
DEVOTION TO THE BLESSED VIRGIN</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>971
&quot;All generations will call me blessed&quot;: &quot;The Church's devotion
to the Blessed Virgin is intrinsic to Christian worship.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-19C href="__P2C.HTM#$19C">513</a></sup></font> The
Church rightly honors &quot;the Blessed Virgin with special devotion. From the
most ancient times the Blessed Virgin has been honored with the title of
'Mother of God,' to whose protection the faithful fly in all their dangers and
needs.... This very special devotion ... differs essentially from the adoration
which is given to the incarnate Word and equally to the Father and the Holy
Spirit, and greatly fosters this adoration.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-19D href="__P2C.HTM#$19D">514</a></sup></font> The liturgical
feasts dedicated to the Mother of God and Marian prayer, such as the rosary, an
&quot;epitome of the whole Gospel,&quot; express this devotion to the Virgin
Mary.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-19E href="__P2C.HTM#$19E">515</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>III. MARY -
ESCHATOLOGICAL ICON OF THE CHURCH</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>972
After speaking of the Church, her origin, mission, and destiny, we can find no
better way to conclude than by looking to Mary. In her we contemplate what the
Church already is in her mystery on her own &quot;pilgrimage of faith,&quot;
and what she will be in the homeland at the end of her journey. There, &quot;in
the glory of the Most Holy and Undivided Trinity,&quot; &quot;in the communion
of all the saints,&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-19F href="__P2C.HTM#$19F">516</a></sup></font> The Church is awaited by the one she
venerates as Mother of her Lord and as her own mother.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>In the meantime the Mother of
Jesus, in the glory which she possesses in body and soul in heaven, is the
image and beginning of the Church as it is to be perfected in the world to
come. Likewise she shines forth on earth until the day of the Lord shall come,
a sign of certain hope and comfort to the pilgrim People of God.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-19G href="__P2C.HTM#$19G">517</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>IN BRIEF</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>973 By pronouncing her
&quot;fiat&quot; at the Annunciation and giving her consent to the Incarnation,
Mary was al ready collaborating with the whole work her Son was to accomplish.
She is mother wherever he is Savior and head of the Mystical Body.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>974 The Most Blessed Virgin
Mary, when the course of her earthly life was completed, was taken up body and
soul into the glory of heaven, where she already shares in the glory of her
Son's Resurrection, anticipating the resurrection of all members of his Body.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>975 &quot;We believe that the
Holy Mother of God, the new Eve, Mother of the Church, continues in heaven to
exercise her maternal role on behalf of the members of Christ&quot; (Paul VI,
CPG # 15).</i></p>
