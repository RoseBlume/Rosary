<p class=MsoNormal>2598
The drama of prayer is fully revealed to us in the Word who became flesh and
dwells among us. To seek to understand his prayer through what his witnesses
proclaim to us in the Gospel is to approach the holy Lord Jesus as Moses
approached the burning bush: first to contemplate him in prayer, then to hear
how he teaches us to pray, in order to know how he hears our prayer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus prays</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2599
The Son of God who became Son of the Virgin learned to pray in his human heart.
He learns to pray from his mother, who kept all the great things the Almighty
had done and treasured them in her heart.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2LB href="__P93.HTM#$2LB">41</a></sup></font> He learns to pray in the
words and rhythms of the prayer of his people, in the synagogue at Nazareth and
the Temple at Jerusalem. But his prayer springs from an otherwise secret
source, as he intimates at the age of twelve: &quot;I must be in my Father's
house.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2LC href="__P93.HTM#$2LC">42</a></sup></font> Here the newness of prayer in the fullness of time
begins to be revealed: his filial prayer, which the Father awaits from his children,
is finally going to be lived out by the only Son in his humanity, with and for
men.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2600
The Gospel according to St. Luke emphasizes the action of the Holy Spirit and
the meaning of prayer in Christ's ministry. Jesus prays before the decisive
moments of his mission: before his Father's witness to him during his baptism
and Transfiguration, and before his own fulfillment of the Father's plan of
love by his Passion.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2LD href="__P93.HTM#$2LD">43</a></sup></font> He also prays before the decisive moments
involving the mission of his apostles: at his election and call of the Twelve,
before Peter's confession of him as &quot;the Christ of God,&quot; and again
that the faith of the chief of the Apostles may not fail when
tempted.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2LE href="__P93.HTM#$2LE">44</a></sup></font> Jesus' prayer before the events of salvation that the Father
has asked him to fulfill is a humble and trusting commitment of his human will
to the loving will of the Father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2601
&quot;He was praying in a certain place and when he had ceased, one of his
disciples said to him, 'Lord, teach us to pray.&quot;'<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2LF href="__P93.HTM#$2LF">45</a></sup></font> In seeing the
Master at prayer the disciple of Christ also wants to pray. By contemplating
and hearing the Son, the master of prayer, the children learn to pray to the
Father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2602
Jesus often draws apart to pray in solitude, on a mountain, preferably at
night.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2LG href="__P93.HTM#$2LG">46</a></sup></font> He includes all men in his prayer, for he has taken on
humanity in his incarnation, and he offers them to the Father when he offers
himself. Jesus, the Word who has become flesh, shares by his human prayer in
all that &quot;his brethren&quot; experience; he sympathizes with their
weaknesses in order to free them.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2LH href="__P93.HTM#$2LH">47</a></sup></font> It was for this that the Father
sent him. His words and works are the visible manifestation of his prayer in
secret.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2603
The evangelists have preserved two more explicit prayers offered by Christ
during his public ministry. Each begins with thanksgiving. In the first, Jesus
confesses the Father, acknowledges, and blesses him because he has hidden the
mysteries of the Kingdom from those who think themselves learned and has
revealed them to infants, the poor of the Beatitudes.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2LI href="__P93.HTM#$2LI">48</a></sup></font> His
exclamation, &quot;Yes, Father!&quot; expresses the depth of his heart, his
adherence to the Father's &quot;good pleasure,&quot; echoing his mother's Fiat
at the time of his conception and prefiguring what he will say to the Father in
his agony. the whole prayer of Jesus is contained in this loving adherence of
his human heart to the mystery of the will of the Father.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2LJ href="__P93.HTM#$2LJ">49</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2604
The second prayer, before the raising of Lazarus, is recorded by St.
John.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2LK href="__P93.HTM#$2LK">50</a></sup></font> Thanksgiving precedes the event: &quot;Father, I thank you for
having heard me,&quot; which implies that the Father always hears his
petitions. Jesus immediately adds: &quot;I know that you always hear me,&quot;
which implies that Jesus, on his part, constantly made such petitions. Jesus'
prayer, characterized by thanksgiving, reveals to us how to ask: before the
gift is given, Jesus commits himself to the One who in giving gives himself.
the Giver is more precious than the gift; he is the &quot;treasure&quot;; in
him abides his Son's heart; the gift is given &quot;as well.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2LL href="__P93.HTM#$2LL">51</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>The priestly prayer of Jesus
holds a unique place in the economy of salvation.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2LM href="__P93.HTM#$2LM">52</a></sup></font> A meditation on it
will conclude Section One. It reveals the ever present prayer of our High
Priest and, at the same time, contains what he teaches us about our prayer to
our Father, which will be developed in Section Two.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2605
When the hour had come for him to fulfill the Father's plan of love, Jesus
allows a glimpse of the boundless depth of his filial prayer, not only before
he freely delivered himself up (&ldquo;Abba . . . not my will, but
yours.&quot;),<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2LN href="__P93.HTM#$2LN">53</a></sup></font> but even in his last words on the Cross, where prayer
and the gift of self are but one: &quot;Father, forgive them, for they know not
what they do&quot;,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2LO href="__P93.HTM#$2LO">54</a></sup></font> &quot;Truly, I say to you, today you will be with
me in Paradise&quot;,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2LP href="__P93.HTM#$2LP">55</a></sup></font> &quot;Woman, behold your son&quot; -
&quot;Behold your mother&quot;,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2LQ href="__P93.HTM#$2LQ">56</a></sup></font> &quot;I thirst.&quot;;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2LR href="__P93.HTM#$2LR">57</a></sup></font>
&quot;My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2LS href="__P93.HTM#$2LS">58</a></sup></font> &quot;It is
finished&quot;;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2LT href="__P93.HTM#$2LT">59</a></sup></font> &quot;Father, into your hands I commit my
spirit!&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2LU href="__P93.HTM#$2LU">60</a></sup></font> until the &quot;loud cry&quot; as he expires, giving up
his spirit.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2LV href="__P93.HTM#$2LV">61</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2606
All the troubles, for all time, of humanity enslaved by sin and death, all the
petitions and intercessions of salvation history are summed up in this cry of
the incarnate Word. Here the Father accepts them and, beyond all hope, answers
them by raising his Son. Thus is fulfilled and brought to completion the drama
of prayer in the economy of creation and salvation. the Psalter gives us the
key to prayer in Christ. In the &quot;today&quot; of the Resurrection the
Father says: &quot;You are my Son, today I have begotten you. Ask of me, and I
will make the nations your heritage, and the ends of the earth your
possession.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2LW href="__P93.HTM#$2LW">62</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>The Letter to the Hebrews
expresses in dramatic terms how the prayer of Jesus accomplished the victory of
salvation: &quot;In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and
supplications, with loud cries and tears, to him who was able to save him from
death, and he was heard for his godly fear. Although he was a Son, he learned
obedience through what he suffered, and being made perfect, he became the
source of eternal salvation to all who obey him.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2LX href="__P93.HTM#$2LX">63</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus
teaches us how to pray</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2607
When Jesus prays he is already teaching us how to pray. His prayer to his
Father is the theological path (the path of faith, hope, and charity) of our
prayer to God. But the Gospel also gives us Jesus' explicit teaching on prayer.
Like a wise teacher he takes hold of us where we are and leads us progressively
toward the Father. Addressing the crowds following him, Jesus builds on what
they already know of prayer from the Old Covenant and opens to them the newness
of the coming Kingdom. Then he reveals this newness to them in parables.
Finally, he will speak openly of the Father and the Holy Spirit to his
disciples who will be the teachers of prayer in his Church.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2608
From the Sermon on the Mount onwards, Jesus insists on conversion of heart:
reconciliation with one's brother before presenting an offering on the altar,
love of enemies, and prayer for persecutors, prayer to the Father in secret,
not heaping up empty phrases, prayerful forgiveness from the depths of the
heart, purity of heart, and seeking the Kingdom before all else.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2LY href="__P93.HTM#$2LY">64</a></sup></font> This
filial conversion is entirely directed to the Father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2609
Once committed to conversion, the heart learns to pray in faith. Faith is a
filial adherence to God beyond what we feel and understand. It is possible
because the beloved Son gives us access to the Father. He can ask us to
&quot;seek&quot; and to &quot;knock,&quot; since he himself is the door and the
way.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2LZ href="__P93.HTM#$2LZ">65</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2610
Just as Jesus prays to the Father and gives thanks before receiving his gifts,
so he teaches us filial boldness: &quot;Whatever you ask in prayer, believe
that you receive it, and you will.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2M0 href="__P93.HTM#$2M0">66</a></sup></font> Such is the power of prayer
and of faith that does not doubt: &quot;all things are possible to him who
believes.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2M1 href="__P93.HTM#$2M1">67</a></sup></font> Jesus is as saddened by the &quot;lack of faith&quot;
of his own neighbors and the &quot;little faith&quot; of his own
disciples<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2M2 href="__P93.HTM#$2M2">68</a></sup></font> as he is struck with admiration at the great faith of the
Roman centurion and the Canaanite woman.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2M3 href="__P93.HTM#$2M3">69</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2611
The prayer of faith consists not only in saying &quot;Lord, Lord,&quot; but in
disposing the heart to do the will of the Father.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2M4 href="__P93.HTM#$2M4">70</a></sup></font> Jesus calls his
disciples to bring into their prayer this concern for cooperating with the
divine plan.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2M5 href="__P93.HTM#$2M5">71</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2612
In Jesus &quot;the Kingdom of God is at hand.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2M6 href="__P93.HTM#$2M6">72</a></sup></font> He calls his
hearers to conversion and faith, but also to watchfulness. In prayer the
disciple keeps watch, attentive to Him Who Is and Him Who Comes, in memory of
his first coming in the lowliness of the flesh, and in the hope of his second
coming in glory.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2M7 href="__P93.HTM#$2M7">73</a></sup></font> In communion with their Master, the disciples'
prayer is a battle; only by keeping watch in prayer can one avoid falling into
temptation.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2M8 href="__P93.HTM#$2M8">74</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2613
Three
principal parables on prayer are transmitted to us by St. Luke: <br>
- the first, &quot;the importunate friend,&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2M9 href="__P93.HTM#$2M9">75</a></sup></font> invites us to urgent
prayer: &quot;Knock, and it will be opened to you.&quot; To the one who prays like
this, the heavenly Father will &quot;give whatever he needs,&quot; and above
all the Holy Spirit who contains all gifts. <br>
- the second, &quot;the importunate widow,&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2MA href="__P93.HTM#$2MA">76</a></sup></font> is centered on one
of the qualities of prayer: it is necessary to pray always without ceasing and
with the patience of faith. &quot;and yet, when the Son of Man comes, will he
find faith on earth?&quot; <br>
- the third parable, &quot;the Pharisee and the tax collector,&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2MB href="__P93.HTM#$2MB">77</a></sup></font>
concerns the humility of the heart that prays. &quot;God, be merciful to me a
sinner!&quot; the Church continues to make this prayer its own: Kyrie eleison!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2614
When Jesus openly entrusts to his disciples the mystery of prayer to the
Father, he reveals to them what their prayer and ours must be, once he has
returned to the Father in his glorified humanity. What is new is to &quot;ask
in his name.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2MC href="__P93.HTM#$2MC">78</a></sup></font> Faith in the Son introduces the disciples into the
knowledge of the Father, because Jesus is &quot;the way, and the truth, and the
life.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2MD href="__P93.HTM#$2MD">79</a></sup></font> Faith bears its fruit in love: it means keeping the word
and the commandments of Jesus, it means abiding with him in the Father who, in
him, so loves us that he abides with us. In this new covenant the certitude
that our petitions will be heard is founded on the prayer of Jesus.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2ME href="__P93.HTM#$2ME">80</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2615
Even more, what the Father gives us when our prayer is united with that of
Jesus is &quot;another Counselor, to be with you for ever, even the Spirit of
truth.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2MF href="__P93.HTM#$2MF">81</a></sup></font> This new dimension of prayer and of its circumstances is
displayed throughout the farewell discourse.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2MG href="__P93.HTM#$2MG">82</a></sup></font> In the Holy Spirit,
Christian prayer is a communion of love with the Father, not only through
Christ but also in him: &quot;Hitherto you have asked nothing in my name; ask,
and you will receive, that your joy may be full.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2MH href="__P93.HTM#$2MH">83</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus hears
our prayer</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2616
Prayer to Jesus is answered by him already during his ministry, through signs
that anticipate the power of his death and Resurrection: Jesus hears the prayer
of faith, expressed in words (the leper, Jairus, the Canaanite woman, the good
thief)<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2MI href="__P93.HTM#$2MI">84</a></sup></font> or in silence (the bearers of the paralytic, the woman with a
hemorrhage who touches his clothes, the tears and ointment of the sinful
woman).<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2MJ href="__P93.HTM#$2MJ">85</a></sup></font> The urgent request of the blind men, &quot;Have mercy on us,
Son of David&quot; or &quot;Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!&quot;
has-been renewed in the traditional prayer to Jesus known as the Jesus Prayer:
&quot;Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a
sinner!&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2MK href="__P93.HTM#$2MK">86</a></sup></font> Healing infirmities or forgiving sins, Jesus always
responds to a prayer offered in faith: &quot;Your faith has made you well; go
in peace.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>St. Augustine wonderfully
summarizes the three dimensions of Jesus' prayer: &quot;He prays for us as our
priest, prays in us as our Head, and is prayed to by us as our God. Therefore
let us acknowledge our voice in him and his in us.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2ML href="__P93.HTM#$2ML">87</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The prayer
of the Virgin Mary</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2617
Mary's prayer is revealed to us at the dawning of the fullness of time. Before
the incarnation of the Son of God, and before the outpouring of the Holy
Spirit, her prayer cooperates in a unique way with the Father's plan of loving
kindness: at the Annunciation, for Christ's conception; at Pentecost, for the
formation of the Church, his Body.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2MM href="__P93.HTM#$2MM">88</a></sup></font> In the faith of his humble
handmaid, the Gift of God found the acceptance he had awaited from the
beginning of time. She whom the Almighty made &quot;full of grace&quot;
responds by offering her whole being: &quot;Behold I am the handmaid of the
Lord; let it be [done] to me according to your word.&quot; &quot;Fiat&quot;:
this is Christian prayer: to be wholly God's, because he is wholly ours.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2618
The Gospel reveals to us how Mary prays and intercedes in faith. At
Cana,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2MN href="__P93.HTM#$2MN">89</a></sup></font> The mother of Jesus asks her son for the needs of a wedding feast;
this is the sign of another feast - that of the wedding of the Lamb where he
gives his body and blood at the request of the Church, his Bride. It is at the
hour of the New Covenant, at the foot of the cross,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2MO href="__P93.HTM#$2MO">90</a></sup></font> that Mary is
heard as the Woman, the new Eve, the true &quot;Mother of all the living.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2619
That is why the Canticle of Mary,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2MP href="__P93.HTM#$2MP">91</a></sup></font> The Magnificat (Latin) or Megalynei
(byzantine) is the song both of the Mother of God and of the Church; the song
of the Daughter of Zion and of the new People of God; the song of thanksgiving
for the fullness of graces poured out in the economy of salvation and the song
of the &quot;poor&quot; whose hope is met by the fulfillment of the promises
made to our ancestors, &quot;to Abraham and to his posterity for ever.&quot;</p>
