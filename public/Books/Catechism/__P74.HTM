<p class=MsoNormal>2032
The Church, the &quot;pillar and bulwark of the truth,&quot; &quot;has received
this solemn command of Christ from the apostles to announce the saving
truth.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-25C href="__P74.HTM#$25C">74</a></sup></font> &quot;To the Church belongs the right always and
everywhere to announce moral principles, including those pertaining to the
social order, and to make judgments on any human affairs to the extent that
they are required by the fundamental rights of the human person or the
salvation of souls.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-25D href="__P74.HTM#$25D">75</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2033
The Magisterium of the Pastors of the Church in moral matters is ordinarily
exercised in catechesis and preaching, with the help of the works of theologians
and spiritual authors. Thus from generation to generation, under the aegis and
vigilance of the pastors, the &quot;deposit&quot; of Christian moral teaching
has been handed on, a deposit composed of a characteristic body of rules,
commandments, and virtues proceeding from faith in Christ and animated by
charity. Alongside the Creed and the Our Father, the basis for this catechesis
has traditionally been the Decalogue which sets out the principles of moral
life valid for all men.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2034
The Roman Pontiff and the bishops are &quot;authentic teachers, that is,
teachers endowed with the authority of Christ, who preach the faith to the
people entrusted to them, the faith to be believed and put into
practice.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-25E href="__P74.HTM#$25E">76</a></sup></font> The ordinary and universal Magisterium of the Pope
and the bishops in communion with him teach the faithful the truth to believe,
the charity to practice, the beatitude to hope for.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2035
The supreme degree of participation in the authority of Christ is ensured by
the charism of infallibility. This infallibility extends as far as does the
deposit of divine Revelation; it also extends to all those elements of
doctrine, including morals, without which the saving truths of the faith cannot
be preserved, explained, or observed.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-25F href="__P74.HTM#$25F">77</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2036
The authority of the Magisterium extends also to the specific precepts of the
natural law, because their observance, demanded by the Creator, is necessary
for salvation. In recalling the prescriptions of the natural law, the
Magisterium of the Church exercises an essential part of its prophetic office
of proclaiming to men what they truly are and reminding them of what they
should be before God.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-25G href="__P74.HTM#$25G">78</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2037
The law of God entrusted to the Church is taught to the faithful as the way of
life and truth. the faithful therefore have the right to be instructed in the
divine saving precepts that purify judgment and, with grace, heal wounded human
reason.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-25H href="__P74.HTM#$25H">79</a></sup></font> They have the duty of observing the constitutions and decrees
conveyed by the legitimate authority of the Church. Even if they concern
disciplinary matters, these determinations call for docility in charity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2038
In the work of teaching and applying Christian morality, the Church needs the
dedication of pastors, the knowledge of theologians, and the contribution of
all Christians and men of good will. Faith and the practice of the Gospel
provide each person with an experience of life &quot;in Christ,&quot; who
enlightens him and makes him able to evaluate the divine and human realities
according to the Spirit of God.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-25I href="__P74.HTM#$25I">80</a></sup></font> Thus the Holy Spirit can use the
humblest to enlighten the learned and those in the highest positions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2039
Ministries should be exercised in a spirit of fraternal service and dedication
to the Church, in the name of the Lord.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-25J href="__P74.HTM#$25J">81</a></sup></font> At the same time the
conscience of each person should avoid confining itself to individualistic
considerations in its moral judgments of the person's own acts. As far as possible
conscience should take account of the good of all, as expressed in the moral
law, natural and revealed, and consequently in the law of the Church and in the
authoritative teaching of the Magisterium on moral questions. Personal
conscience and reason should not be set in opposition to the moral law or the
Magisterium of the Church.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2040
Thus a true filial spirit toward the Church can develop among Christians. It is
the normal flowering of the baptismal grace which has begotten us in the womb
of the Church and made us members of the Body of Christ. In her motherly care,
the Church grants us the mercy of God which prevails over all our sins and is
especially at work in the sacrament of reconciliation. With a mother's
foresight, she also lavishes on us day after day in her liturgy the nourishment
of the Word and Eucharist of the Lord.</p>
