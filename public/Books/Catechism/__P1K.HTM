<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Paragraph 2. &quot;CONCEIVED BY THE POWER OF
THE HOLY SPIRIT AND BORN OF THE VIRGIN MARY&quot;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I.
CONCEIVED BY THE POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT. . .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>484
The Annunciation to Mary inaugurates &quot;the fullness of
time&quot;,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-I3 href="__P1K.HTM#$I3">119</a></sup></font> The time of the fulfilment of God's promises and
preparations. Mary was invited to conceive him in whom the &quot;whole fullness
of deity&quot; would dwell &quot;bodily&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-I4 href="__P1K.HTM#$I4">120</a></sup></font> The divine response
to her question, &quot;How can this be, since I know not man?&quot;, was given
by the power of the Spirit: &quot;The Holy Spirit will come upon
you.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-I5 href="__P1K.HTM#$I5">121</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>485
The mission of the Holy Spirit is always conjoined and ordered to that of the
Son.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-I6 href="__P1K.HTM#$I6">122</a></sup></font> The Holy Spirit, &quot;the Lord, the giver of Life&quot;, is
sent to sanctify the womb of the Virgin Mary and divinely fecundate it, causing
her to conceive the eternal Son of the Father in a humanity drawn from her own.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>486
The Father's only Son, conceived as man in the womb of the Virgin Mary, is
&quot;Christ&quot;, that is to say, anointed by the Holy Spirit, from the
beginning of his human existence, though the manifestation of this fact takes
place only progressively: to the shepherds, to the magi, to John the Baptist,
to the disciples.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-I7 href="__P1K.HTM#$I7">123</a></sup></font> Thus the whole life of Jesus Christ will make
manifest &quot;how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with
power.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-I8 href="__P1K.HTM#$I8">124</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>II.... BORN
OF THE VIRGIN MARY</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>487
What the Catholic faith believes about Mary is based on what it believes about
Christ, and what it teaches about Mary illumines in turn its faith in Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mary's
predestination</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>488
&quot;God sent forth his Son&quot;, but to prepare a body for him,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-I9 href="__P1K.HTM#$I9">125</a></sup></font>
he wanted the free co-operation of a creature. For this, from all eternity God
chose for the mother of his Son a daughter of Israel, a young Jewish woman of
Nazareth in Galilee, &quot;a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph,
of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary&quot;:<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-IA href="__P1K.HTM#$IA">126</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>The Father of mercies willed
that the Incarnation should be preceded by assent on the part of the
predestined mother, so that just as a woman had a share in the coming of death,
so also should a woman contribute to the coming of life.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-IB href="__P1K.HTM#$IB">127</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>489
Throughout the Old Covenant the mission of many holy women prepared for that of
Mary. At the very beginning there was Eve; despite her disobedience, she receives
the promise of a posterity that will be victorious over the evil one, as well
as the promise that she will be the mother of all the living.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-IC href="__P1K.HTM#$IC">128</a></sup></font> By
virtue of this promise, Sarah conceives a son in spite of her old
age.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-ID href="__P1K.HTM#$ID">129</a></sup></font> Against all human expectation God chooses those who were
considered powerless and weak to show forth his faithfulness to his promises:
Hannah, the mother of Samuel; Deborah; Ruth; Judith and Esther; and many other
women.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-IE href="__P1K.HTM#$IE">130</a></sup></font> Mary &quot;stands out among the poor and humble of the Lord,
who confidently hope for and receive salvation from him. After a long period of
waiting the times are fulfilled in her, the exalted Daughter of Sion, and the
new plan of salvation is established.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-IF href="__P1K.HTM#$IF">131</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The
Immaculate Conception</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>490
To become the mother of the Saviour, Mary &quot;was enriched by God with gifts
appropriate to such a role.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-IG href="__P1K.HTM#$IG">132</a></sup></font> The angel Gabriel at the moment of
the annunciation salutes her as &quot;full of grace&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-IH href="__P1K.HTM#$IH">133</a></sup></font> In fact,
in order for Mary to be able to give the free assent of her faith to the
announcement of her vocation, it was necessary that she be wholly borne by
God's grace.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>491
Through the centuries the Church has become ever more aware that Mary,
&quot;full of grace&quot; through God,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-II href="__P1K.HTM#$II">134</a></sup></font> was redeemed from the moment
of her conception. That is what the dogma of the Immaculate Conception
confesses, as Pope Pius IX proclaimed in 1854:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>The most Blessed Virgin Mary
was, from the first moment of her conception, by a singular grace and privilege
of almighty God and by virtue of the merits of Jesus Christ, Saviour of the
human race, preserved immune from all stain of original sin.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-IJ href="__P1K.HTM#$IJ">135</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>492
The &quot;splendour of an entirely unique holiness&quot; by which Mary is
&quot;enriched from the first instant of her conception&quot; comes wholly from
Christ: she is &quot;redeemed, in a more exalted fashion, by reason of the
merits of her Son&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-IK href="__P1K.HTM#$IK">136</a></sup></font> The Father blessed Mary more than any other
created person &quot;in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly
places&quot; and chose her &quot;in Christ before the foundation of the world,
to be holy and blameless before him in love&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-IL href="__P1K.HTM#$IL">137</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>493
The Fathers of the Eastern tradition call the Mother of God &quot;the
All-Holy&quot; (Panagia), and celebrate her as &quot;free from any stain of
sin, as though fashioned by the Holy Spirit and formed as a new
creature&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-IM href="__P1K.HTM#$IM">138</a></sup></font> By the grace of God Mary remained free of every
personal sin her whole life long. <br>
&quot;Let it be done to me according to your word. . .&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>494
At the announcement that she would give birth to &quot;the Son of the Most
High&quot; without knowing man, by the power of the Holy Spirit, Mary responded
with the obedience of faith, certain that &quot;with God nothing will be impossible&quot;:
&quot;Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be [done] to me according
to your word.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-IN href="__P1K.HTM#$IN">139</a></sup></font> Thus, giving her consent to God's word, Mary
becomes the mother of Jesus. Espousing the divine will for salvation
wholeheartedly, without a single sin to restrain her, she gave herself entirely
to the person and to the work of her Son; she did so in order to serve the
mystery of redemption with him and dependent on him, by God's grace:<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-IO href="__P1K.HTM#$IO">140</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>As St. Irenaeus says,
&quot;Being obedient she became the cause of salvation for herself and for the
whole human race.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-IP href="__P1K.HTM#$IP">141</a></sup></font> Hence not a few of the early Fathers gladly
assert. . .: &quot;The knot of Eve's disobedience was untied by Mary's
obedience: what the virgin Eve bound through her disbelief, Mary loosened by
her faith.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-IQ href="__P1K.HTM#$IQ">142</a></sup></font> Comparing her with Eve, they call Mary &quot;the
Mother of the living&quot; and frequently claim: &quot;Death through Eve, life
through Mary.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-IR href="__P1K.HTM#$IR">143</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mary's
divine motherhood</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>495
Called in the Gospels &quot;the mother of Jesus&quot;, Mary is acclaimed by
Elizabeth, at the prompting of the Spirit and even before the birth of her son,
as &quot;the mother of my Lord&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-IS href="__P1K.HTM#$IS">144</a></sup></font> In fact, the One whom she
conceived as man by the Holy Spirit, who truly became her Son according to the
flesh, was none other than the Father's eternal Son, the second person of the
Holy Trinity. Hence the Church confesses that Mary is truly &quot;Mother of
God&quot; (Theotokos).<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-IT href="__P1K.HTM#$IT">145</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mary's
virginity</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>496
From the first formulations of her faith, the Church has confessed that Jesus
was conceived solely by the power of the Holy Spirit in the womb of the Virgin
Mary, affirming also the corporeal aspect of this event: Jesus was conceived
&quot;by the Holy Spirit without human seed&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-IU href="__P1K.HTM#$IU">146</a></sup></font> The Fathers see
in the virginal conception the sign that it truly was the Son of God who came
in a humanity like our own. Thus St. Ignatius of Antioch at the beginning of
the second century says: <br>
You are firmly convinced about our Lord, who is truly of the race of David according
to the flesh, Son of God according to the will and power of God, truly born of
a virgin,. . . he was truly nailed to a tree for us in his flesh under Pontius
Pilate. . . he truly suffered, as he is also truly risen.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-IV href="__P1K.HTM#$IV">147</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>497
The Gospel accounts understand the virginal conception of Jesus as a divine
work that surpasses all human understanding and possibility:<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-IW href="__P1K.HTM#$IW">148</a></sup></font>
&quot;That which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit&quot;, said the
angel to Joseph about Mary his fiancee.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-IX href="__P1K.HTM#$IX">149</a></sup></font> The Church sees here the
fulfilment of the divine promise given through the prophet Isaiah:
&quot;Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-IY href="__P1K.HTM#$IY">150</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>498
People
are sometimes troubled by the silence of St. Mark's Gospel and the New
Testament Epistles about Jesus' virginal conception. Some might wonder if we
were merely dealing with legends or theological constructs not claiming to be
history. To this we must respond: Faith in the virginal conception of Jesus met
with the lively opposition, mockery or incomprehension of non-believers, Jews
and pagans alike;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-IZ href="__P1K.HTM#$IZ">151</a></sup></font> so it could hardly have been motivated by pagan
mythology or by some adaptation to the ideas of the age. the meaning of this
event is accessible only to faith, which understands in it the &quot;connection
of these mysteries with one another&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-J0 href="__P1K.HTM#$J0">152</a></sup></font> in the totality of
Christ's mysteries, from his Incarnation to his Passover. St. Ignatius of
Antioch already bears witness to this connection: &quot;Mary's virginity and
giving birth, and even the Lord's death escaped the notice of the prince of
this world: these three mysteries worthy of proclamation were accomplished in
God's silence.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-J1 href="__P1K.HTM#$J1">153</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mary -
&quot;ever-virgin&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>499
The deepening of faith in the virginal motherhood led the Church to confess
Mary's real and perpetual virginity even in the act of giving birth to the Son
of God made man.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-J2 href="__P1K.HTM#$J2">154</a></sup></font> In fact, Christ's birth &quot;did not diminish his
mother's virginal integrity but sanctified it.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-J3 href="__P1K.HTM#$J3">155</a></sup></font> and so the
liturgy of the Church celebrates Mary as Aeiparthenos, the
&quot;Ever-virgin&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-J4 href="__P1K.HTM#$J4">156</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>500
Against
this doctrine the objection is sometimes raised that the Bible mentions
brothers and sisters of Jesus.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-J5 href="__P1K.HTM#$J5">157</a></sup></font> The Church has always understood
these passages as not referring to other children of the Virgin Mary. In fact
James and Joseph, &quot;brothers of Jesus&quot;, are the sons of another Mary,
a disciple of Christ, whom St. Matthew significantly calls &quot;the other
Mary&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-J6 href="__P1K.HTM#$J6">158</a></sup></font> They are close relations of Jesus, according to an Old
Testament expression.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-J7 href="__P1K.HTM#$J7">159</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>501
Jesus is Mary's only son, but her spiritual motherhood extends to all men whom
indeed he came to save: &quot;The Son whom she brought forth is he whom God
placed as the first-born among many brethren, that is, the faithful in whose
generation and formation she co-operates with a mother's love.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-J8 href="__P1K.HTM#$J8">160</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mary's
virginal motherhood in God's plan</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>502
The eyes of faith can discover in the context of the whole of Revelation the
mysterious reasons why God in his saving plan wanted his Son to be born of a
virgin. These reasons touch both on the person of Christ and his redemptive
mission, and on the welcome Mary gave that mission on behalf of all men.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>503
Mary's
virginity manifests God's absolute initiative in the Incarnation. Jesus has
only God as Father. &quot;He was never estranged from the Father because of the
human nature which he assumed. . . He is naturally Son of the Father as to his divinity
and naturally son of his mother as to his humanity, but properly Son of the
Father in both natures.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-J9 href="__P1K.HTM#$J9">161</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>504
Jesus
is conceived by the Holy Spirit in the Virgin Mary's womb because he is the New
Adam, who inaugurates the new creation: &quot;The first man was from the earth,
a man of dust; the second man is from heaven.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-JA href="__P1K.HTM#$JA">162</a></sup></font> From his
conception, Christ's humanity is filled with the Holy Spirit, for God
&quot;gives him the Spirit without measure.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-JB href="__P1K.HTM#$JB">163</a></sup></font> From &quot;his
fullness&quot; as the head of redeemed humanity &quot;we have all received,
grace upon grace.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-JC href="__P1K.HTM#$JC">164</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>505
By his
virginal conception, Jesus, the New Adam, ushers in the new birth of children
adopted in the Holy Spirit through faith. &quot;How can this be?&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-JD href="__P1K.HTM#$JD">165</a></sup></font>
Participation in the divine life arises &quot;not of blood nor of the will of
the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-JE href="__P1K.HTM#$JE">166</a></sup></font> The acceptance
of this life is virginal because it is entirely the Spirit's gift to man. the
spousal character of the human vocation in relation to God<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-JF href="__P1K.HTM#$JF">167</a></sup></font> is
fulfilled perfectly in Mary's virginal motherhood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>506
Mary
is a virgin because her virginity is the sign of her faith &quot;unadulterated
by any doubt&quot;, and of her undivided gift of herself to God's
will.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-JG href="__P1K.HTM#$JG">168</a></sup></font> It is her faith that enables her to become the mother of the
Saviour: &quot;Mary is more blessed because she embraces faith in Christ than
because she conceives the flesh of Christ.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-JH href="__P1K.HTM#$JH">169</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>507
At
once virgin and mother, Mary is the symbol and the most perfect realization of
the Church: &quot;the Church indeed. . . by receiving the word of God in faith
becomes herself a mother. By preaching and Baptism she brings forth sons, who
are conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of God, to a new and immortal life.
She herself is a virgin, who keeps in its entirety and purity the faith she
pledged to her spouse.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-JI href="__P1K.HTM#$JI">170</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>IN BRIEF</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>508 From among the
descendants of Eve, God chose the Virgin Mary to be the mother of his Son.
&quot;Full of grace&quot;, Mary is &quot;the most excellent fruit of
redemption&quot; (SC 103): from the first instant of her conception, she was
totally preserved from the stain of original sin and she remained pure from all
personal sin throughout her life.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>509 Mary is truly
&quot;Mother of God&quot; since she is the mother of the eternal Son of God
made man, who is God himself.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>510 Mary &quot;remained a
virgin in conceiving her Son, a virgin in giving birth to him, a virgin in
carrying him, a virgin in nursing him at her breast, always a virgin&quot; (St.
Augustine, Serm. 186, 1: PL 38, 999): with her whole being she is &quot;the
handmaid of the Lord&quot; (Lk 1:38).</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>511 The Virgin Mary
&quot;co-operated through free faith and obedience in human salvation&quot; (LG
56). She uttered her yes &quot;in the name of all human nature&quot; (St.
Thomas Aquinas, S Th III, 30, 1). By her obedience she became the new Eve,
mother of the living.</i></p>
