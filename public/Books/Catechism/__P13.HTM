<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>The Credo</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The
Apostles Creed</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I believe
in God the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth.<br>
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord.<br>
He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary<br>
Under Pontius Pilate He was crucified, died, and was buried. <br>
He descended to the dead.<br>
On the third day he rose again.<br>
He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. <br>
He will come again to judge the living and the dead.<br>
<br>
I believe in the Holy Spirit, <br>
the holy catholic Church, <br>
the communion of saints, <br>
the forgiveness of sins, <br>
the resurrection of the body, <br>
and the life everlasting. <br>
Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Nicene
Creed</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We believe
in one God, the Father, the Almighty, <br>
maker of heaven and earth, <br>
of all that is, seen and unseen. <br>
We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, <br>
the only Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father, <br>
God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, <br>
begotten, not made, of one Being with the Father. <br>
Through him all things were made. <br>
For us men and for our salvation, he came down from heaven: <br>
by the power of the Holy Spirit he was born of the Virgin Mary, and became man.
<br>
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate; he suffered died and was
buried. <br>
On the third day he rose again in fulfillment of the Scriptures; <br>
he ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. <br>
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, <br>
and his kingdom will have no end. <br>
<br>
We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, <br>
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.<br>
With the Father and the Son he is worshipped and glorified.<br>
He has spoken through the Prophets. <br>
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church. <br>
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins. <br>
We look for the resurrection of the dead, <br>
and the life of the world to come. <br>
Amen.</p>
