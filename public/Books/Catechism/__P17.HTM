<p class=MsoNormal>I. &quot;IN
THE NAME OF THE FATHER AND OF THE SON AND OF THE HOLY SPIRIT&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>232
Christians are baptized &quot;in the name of the Father and of the Son and of
the Holy Spirit&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-7P href="__P17.HTM#$7P">53</a></sup></font> Before receiving the sacrament, they respond to
a three-part question when asked to confess the Father, the Son and the Spirit:
&quot;I do.&quot; &quot;The faith of all Christians rests on the
Trinity.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-7Q href="__P17.HTM#$7Q">54</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>233
Christians are baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the
Holy Spirit: not in their names,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-7R href="__P17.HTM#$7R">55</a></sup></font> for there is only one God, the
almighty Father, his only Son and the Holy Spirit: the Most Holy Trinity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>234
The mystery of the Most Holy Trinity is the central mystery of Christian faith
and life. It is the mystery of God in himself. It is therefore the source of
all the other mysteries of faith, the light that enlightens them. It is the
most fundamental and essential teaching in the &quot;hierarchy of the truths of
faith&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-7S href="__P17.HTM#$7S">56</a></sup></font> The whole history of salvation is identical with the
history of the way and the means by which the one true God, Father, Son and
Holy Spirit, reveals himself to men &quot;and reconciles and unites with himself
those who turn away from sin&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-7T href="__P17.HTM#$7T">57</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>235
This paragraph expounds briefly (I) how the mystery of the Blessed Trinity was
revealed, (II) how the Church has articulated the doctrine of the faith
regarding this mystery, and (III) how, by the divine missions of the Son and
the Holy Spirit, God the Father fulfils the &quot;plan of his loving
goodness&quot; of creation, redemption and sanctification.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>236
The
Fathers of the Church distinguish between theology (theologia) and economy
(oikonomia). &quot;Theology&quot; refers to the mystery of God's inmost life
within the Blessed Trinity and &quot;economy&quot; to all the works by which
God reveals himself and communicates his life. Through the oikonomia the
theologia is revealed to us; but conversely, the theologia illuminates the
whole oikonomia. God's works reveal who he is in himself; the mystery of his
inmost being enlightens our understanding of all his works. So it is,
analogously, among human persons. A person discloses himself in his actions,
and the better we know a person, the better we understand his actions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>237
The Trinity is a mystery of faith in the strict sense, one of the
&quot;mysteries that are hidden in God, which can never be known unless they
are revealed by God&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-7U href="__P17.HTM#$7U">58</a></sup></font> To be sure, God has left traces of his
Trinitarian being in his work of creation and in his Revelation throughout the
Old Testament. But his inmost Being as Holy Trinity is a mystery that is
inaccessible to reason alone or even to Israel's faith before the Incarnation
of God's Son and the sending of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>II. THE
REVELATION OF GOD AS TRINITY</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Father
revealed by the Son</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>238
Many religions invoke God as &quot;Father&quot;. the deity is often considered
the &quot;father of gods and of men&quot;. In Israel, God is called
&quot;Father&quot; inasmuch as he is Creator of the world.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-7V href="__P17.HTM#$7V">59</a></sup></font> Even more,
God is Father because of the covenant and the gift of the law to Israel,
&quot;his first-born son&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-7W href="__P17.HTM#$7W">60</a></sup></font> God is also called the Father of the
king of Israel. Most especially he is &quot;the Father of the poor&quot;, of
the orphaned and the widowed, who are under his loving protection.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-7X href="__P17.HTM#$7X">61</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>239
By
calling God &quot;Father&quot;, the language of faith indicates two main
things: that God is the first origin of everything and transcendent authority;
and that he is at the same time goodness and loving care for all his children.
God's parental tenderness can also be expressed by the image of
motherhood,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-7Y href="__P17.HTM#$7Y">62</a></sup></font> which emphasizes God's immanence, the intimacy between
Creator and creature. the language of faith thus draws on the human experience
of parents, who are in a way the first representatives of God for man. But this
experience also tells us that human parents are fallible and can disfigure the
face of fatherhood and motherhood. We ought therefore to recall that God
transcends the human distinction between the sexes. He is neither man nor
woman: he is God. He also transcends human fatherhood and motherhood, although
he is their origin and standard:<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-7Z href="__P17.HTM#$7Z">63</a></sup></font> no one is father as God is Father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>240
Jesus revealed that God is Father in an unheard-of sense: he is Father not only
in being Creator; he is eternally Father by his relationship to his only Son
who, reciprocally, is Son only in relation to his Father: &quot;No one knows
the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and any
one to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-80 href="__P17.HTM#$80">64</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>241
For this reason the apostles confess Jesus to be the Word: &quot;In the
beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God&quot;;
as &quot;the image of the invisible God&quot;; as the &quot;radiance of the
glory of God and the very stamp of his nature&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-81 href="__P17.HTM#$81">65</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>242
Following this apostolic tradition, the Church confessed at the first
ecumenical council at Nicaea (325) that the Son is &quot;consubstantial&quot;
with the Father, that is, one only God with him.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-82 href="__P17.HTM#$82">66</a></sup></font> The second
ecumenical council, held at Constantinople in 381, kept this expression in its
formulation of the Nicene Creed and confessed &quot;the only-begotten Son of
God, eternally begotten of the Father, light from light, true God from true
God, begotten not made, consubstantial with the Father&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-83 href="__P17.HTM#$83">67</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Father
and the son revealed by the spirit</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>243
Before his Passover, Jesus announced the sending of &quot;another
Paraclete&quot; (Advocate), the Holy Spirit. At work since creation, having
previously &quot;spoken through the prophets&quot;, the Spirit will now be with
and in the disciples, to teach them and guide them &quot;into all the
truth&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-84 href="__P17.HTM#$84">68</a></sup></font> The Holy Spirit is thus revealed as another divine
person with Jesus and the Father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>244
The eternal origin of the Holy Spirit is revealed in his mission in time. the
Spirit is sent to the apostles and to the Church both by the Father in the name
of the Son, and by the Son in person, once he had returned to the
Father.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-85 href="__P17.HTM#$85">69</a></sup></font> The sending of the person of the Spirit after Jesus'
glorification<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-86 href="__P17.HTM#$86">70</a></sup></font> reveals in its fullness the mystery of the Holy Trinity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>245
The apostolic faith concerning the Spirit was confessed by the second
ecumenical council at Constantinople (381): &quot;We believe in the Holy
Spirit, the Lord and giver of life, who proceeds from the
Father.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-87 href="__P17.HTM#$87">71</a></sup></font> By this confession, the Church recognizes the Father as
&quot;the source and origin of the whole divinity&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-88 href="__P17.HTM#$88">72</a></sup></font> But the
eternal origin of the Spirit is not unconnected with the Son's origin:
&quot;The Holy Spirit, the third person of the Trinity, is God, one and equal with
the Father and the Son, of the same substance and also of the same nature. . .
Yet he is not called the Spirit of the Father alone,. . . but the Spirit of
both the Father and the Son.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-89 href="__P17.HTM#$89">73</a></sup></font> The Creed of the Church from the
Council of Constantinople confesses: &quot;With the Father and the Son, he is
worshipped and glorified.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-8A href="__P17.HTM#$8A">74</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>246
The Latin tradition of the Creed confesses that the Spirit &quot;proceeds from
the Father and the Son (filioque)&quot;. the Council of Florence in 1438 explains:
&quot;The Holy Spirit is eternally from Father and Son; He has his nature and
subsistence at once (simul) from the Father and the Son. He proceeds eternally
from both as from one principle and through one spiration... And, since the
Father has through generation given to the only-begotten Son everything that
belongs to the Father, except being Father, the Son has also eternally from the
Father, from whom he is eternally born, that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the
Son.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-8B href="__P17.HTM#$8B">75</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>247
The affirmation
of the filioque does not appear in the Creed confessed in 381 at
Constantinople. But Pope St. Leo I, following an ancient Latin and Alexandrian
tradition, had already confessed it dogmatically in 447,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-8C href="__P17.HTM#$8C">76</a></sup></font> even before
Rome, in 451 at the Council of Chalcedon, came to recognize and receive the
Symbol of 381. the use of this formula in the Creed was gradually admitted into
the Latin liturgy (between the eighth and eleventh centuries). the introduction
of the filioque into the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed by the Latin liturgy
constitutes moreover, even today, a point of disagreement with the Orthodox
Churches.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>248
At the
outset the Eastern tradition expresses the Father's character as first origin
of the Spirit. By confessing the Spirit as he &quot;who proceeds from the
Father&quot;, it affirms that he comes from the Father through the
Son.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-8D href="__P17.HTM#$8D">77</a></sup></font> The Western tradition expresses first the consubstantial
communion between Father and Son, by saying that the Spirit proceeds from the
Father and the Son (filioque). It says this, &quot;legitimately and with good
reason&quot;,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-8E href="__P17.HTM#$8E">78</a></sup></font> for the eternal order of the divine persons in their
consubstantial communion implies that the Father, as &quot;the principle
without principle&quot;,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-8F href="__P17.HTM#$8F">79</a></sup></font> is the first origin of the Spirit, but also
that as Father of the only Son, he is, with the Son, the single principle from
which the Holy Spirit proceeds.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-8G href="__P17.HTM#$8G">80</a></sup></font> This legitimate complementarity,
provided it does not become rigid, does not affect the identity of faith in the
reality of the same mystery confessed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>III. THE
HOLY TRINITY IN THE TEACHING OF THE FAITH</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The
formation of the Trinitarian dogma</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>249
From the beginning, the revealed truth of the Holy Trinity has been at the very
root of the Church's living faith, principally by means of Baptism. It finds
its expression in the rule of baptismal faith, formulated in the preaching,
catechesis and prayer of the Church. Such formulations are already found in the
apostolic writings, such as this salutation taken up in the Eucharistic
liturgy: &quot;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the
fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-8H href="__P17.HTM#$8H">81</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>250
During the first centuries the Church sought to clarify her Trinitarian faith,
both to deepen her own understanding of the faith and to defend it against the
errors that were deforming it. This clarification was the work of the early
councils, aided by the theological work of the Church Fathers and sustained by
the Christian people's sense of the faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>251
In order to articulate the dogma of the Trinity, the Church had to develop her
own terminology with the help of certain notions of philosophical origin:
&quot;substance&quot;, &quot;person&quot; or &quot;hypostasis&quot;, &quot;relation&quot;
and so on. In doing this, she did not submit the faith to human wisdom, but
gave a new and unprecedented meaning to these terms, which from then on would
be used to signify an ineffable mystery, &quot;infinitely beyond all that we
can humanly understand&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-8I href="__P17.HTM#$8I">82</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>252
The Church uses (I) the term &quot;substance&quot; (rendered also at times by
&quot;essence&quot; or &quot;nature&quot;) to designate the divine being in its
unity, (II) the term &quot;person&quot; or &quot;hypostasis&quot; to designate
the Father, Son and Holy Spirit in the real distinction among them, and (III)
the term &quot;relation&quot; to designate the fact that their distinction lies
in the relationship of each to the others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The dogma
of the Holy Trinity</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>253
The Trinity is One. We do not confess three Gods, but one God in three persons,
the &quot;consubstantial Trinity&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-8J href="__P17.HTM#$8J">83</a></sup></font> The divine persons do not
share the one divinity among themselves but each of them is God whole and
entire: &quot;The Father is that which the Son is, the Son that which the
Father is, the Father and the Son that which the Holy Spirit is, i.e. by nature
one God.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-8K href="__P17.HTM#$8K">84</a></sup></font> In the words of the Fourth Lateran Council (1215),
&quot;Each of the persons is that supreme reality, viz., the divine substance,
essence or nature.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-8L href="__P17.HTM#$8L">85</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>254
The divine persons are really distinct from one another. &quot;God is one but
not solitary.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-8M href="__P17.HTM#$8M">86</a></sup></font> &quot;Father&quot;, &quot;Son&quot;, &quot;Holy
Spirit&quot; are not simply names designating modalities of the divine being,
for they are really distinct from one another: &quot;He is not the Father who
is the Son, nor is the Son he who is the Father, nor is the Holy Spirit he who
is the Father or the Son.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-8N href="__P17.HTM#$8N">87</a></sup></font> They are distinct from one another in
their relations of origin: &quot;It is the Father who generates, the Son who is
begotten, and the Holy Spirit who proceeds.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-8O href="__P17.HTM#$8O">88</a></sup></font> The divine Unity is
Triune.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>255
The divine persons are relative to one another. Because it does not divide the
divine unity, the real distinction of the persons from one another resides
solely in the relationships which relate them to one another: &quot;In the
relational names of the persons the Father is related to the Son, the Son to
the Father, and the Holy Spirit to both. While they are called three persons in
view of their relations, we believe in one nature or substance.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-8P href="__P17.HTM#$8P">89</a></sup></font>
Indeed &quot;everything (in them) is one where there is no opposition of
relationship.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-8Q href="__P17.HTM#$8Q">90</a></sup></font> &quot;Because of that unity the Father is wholly
in the Son and wholly in the Holy Spirit; the Son is wholly in the Father and
wholly in the Holy Spirit; the Holy Spirit is wholly in the Father and wholly
in the Son.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-8R href="__P17.HTM#$8R">91</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>256 St. Gregory of Nazianzus,
also called &quot;the Theologian&quot;, entrusts this summary of Trinitarian
faith to the catechumens of Constantinople: <br>
Above
all guard for me this great deposit of faith for which I live and fight, which
I want to take with me as a companion, and which makes me bear all evils and
despise all pleasures: I mean the profession of faith in the Father and the Son
and the Holy Spirit. I entrust it to you today. By it I am soon going to plunge
you into water and raise you up from it. I give it to you as the companion and
patron of your whole life. I give you but one divinity and power, existing one
in three, and containing the three in a distinct way. Divinity without
disparity of substance or nature, without superior degree that raises up or
inferior degree that casts down. . . the infinite co-naturality of three
infinites. Each person considered in himself is entirely God. . . the three considered
together. . . I have not even begun to think of unity when the Trinity bathes
me in its splendour. I have not even begun to think of the Trinity when unity
grasps me. .<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-8S href="__P17.HTM#$8S">92</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>IV. THE DIVINE WORKS AND THE TRINITARIAN
MISSIONS</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>257
&quot;O blessed light, O Trinity and first Unity!&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-8T href="__P17.HTM#$8T">93</a></sup></font> God is
eternal blessedness, undying life, unfading light. God is love: Father, Son and
Holy Spirit. God freely wills to communicate the glory of his blessed life.
Such is the &quot;plan of his loving kindness&quot;, conceived by the Father
before the foundation of the world, in his beloved Son: &quot;He destined us in
love to be his sons&quot; and &quot;to be conformed to the image of his
Son&quot;, through &quot;the spirit of sonship&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-8U href="__P17.HTM#$8U">94</a></sup></font> This plan is a
&quot;grace [which] was given to us in Christ Jesus before the ages
began&quot;, stemming immediately from Trinitarian love.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-8V href="__P17.HTM#$8V">95</a></sup></font> It unfolds
in the work of creation, the whole history of salvation after the fall, and the
missions of the Son and the Spirit, which are continued in the mission of the
Church.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-8W href="__P17.HTM#$8W">96</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>258
The whole divine economy is the common work of the three divine persons. For as
the Trinity has only one and the same natures so too does it have only one and
the same operation: &quot;The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are not three
principles of creation but one principle.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-8X href="__P17.HTM#$8X">97</a></sup></font> However, each divine
person performs the common work according to his unique personal property. Thus
the Church confesses, following the New Testament, &quot;one God and Father
from whom all things are, and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom all things
are, and one Holy Spirit in whom all things are&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-8Y href="__P17.HTM#$8Y">98</a></sup></font> It is above
all the divine missions of the Son's Incarnation and the gift of the Holy
Spirit that show forth the properties of the divine persons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>259
Being a work at once common and personal, the whole divine economy makes known
both what is proper to the divine persons, and their one divine nature. Hence
the whole Christian life is a communion with each of the divine persons,
without in any way separating them. Everyone who glorifies the Father does so
through the Son in the Holy Spirit; everyone who follows Christ does so because
the Father draws him and the Spirit moves him.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-8Z href="__P17.HTM#$8Z">99</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>260
The ultimate end of the whole divine economy is the entry of God's creatures
into the perfect unity of the Blessed Trinity.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-90 href="__P17.HTM#$90">100</a></sup></font> But even now we are
called to be a dwelling for the Most Holy Trinity: &quot;If a man loves
me&quot;, says the Lord, &quot;he will keep my word, and my Father will love
him, and we will come to him, and make our home with him&quot;:<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-91 href="__P17.HTM#$91">101</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>O my God, Trinity whom I
adore, help me forget myself entirely so to establish myself in you, unmovable and
peaceful as if my soul were already in eternity. May nothing be able to trouble
my peace or make me leave you, O my unchanging God, but may each minute bring
me more deeply into your mystery! Grant my soul peace. Make it your heaven,
your beloved dwelling and the place of your rest. May I never abandon you
there, but may I be there, whole and entire, completely vigilant in my faith,
entirely adoring, and wholly given over to your creative action.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-92 href="__P17.HTM#$92">102</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>IN BRIEF</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>261 The mystery of the Most
Holy Trinity is the central mystery of the Christian faith and of Christian
life. God alone can make it known to us by revealing himself as Father, Son and

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>262 The Incarnation of God's
Son reveals that God is the eternal Father and that the Son is consubstantial
with the Father, which means that, in the Father and with the Father the Son is
one and the same God.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>263 The mission of the Holy
Spirit, sent by the Father in the name of the Son (Jn
14:26) and by the Son &quot;from the Father&quot;
(Jn 15:26), reveals that, with them, the
Spirit is one and the same God. &quot;With the Father and the Son he is
worshipped and glorified&quot; (Nicene Creed).</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>264 &quot;The Holy Spirit
proceeds from the Father as the first principle and, by the eternal gift of
this to the Son, from the communion of both the Father and the Son&quot; (St.
Augustine, De Trin. 15, 26, 47: PL 42, 1095).</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>265 By the grace of Baptism
&quot;in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&quot;, we
are called to share in the life of the Blessed Trinity, here on earth in the
obscurity of faith, and after death in eternal light (cf. Paul VI, CPG # 9).</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>266 &quot;Now this is the
Catholic faith: We worship one God in the Trinity and the Trinity in unity,
without either confusing the persons or dividing the substance; for the person
of the Father is one, the Son's is another, the Holy Spirit's another; but the
Godhead of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit is one, their glory equal, their
majesty coeternal&quot; (Athanasian Creed: DS 75; ND 16).</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>267 Inseparable in what they
are, the divine persons are also inseparable in what they do. But within the
single divine operation each shows forth what is proper to him in the Trinity,
especially in the divine missions of the Son's Incarnation and the gift of the
Holy Spirit.</i></p>
