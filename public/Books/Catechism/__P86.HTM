<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>III. The </b><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>Love of Husband and
Wife</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2360
Sexuality is ordered to the conjugal love of man and woman. In marriage the
physical intimacy of the spouses becomes a sign and pledge of spiritual
communion. Marriage bonds between baptized persons are sanctified by the
sacrament.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2361
&quot;Sexuality, by means of which man and woman give themselves to one another
through the acts which are proper and exclusive to spouses, is not something
simply biological, but concerns the innermost being of the human person as
such. It is realized in a truly human way only if it is an integral part of the
love by which a man and woman commit themselves totally to one another until
death.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2E6 href="__P86.HTM#$2E6">142</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>Tobias got out of bed and said
to Sarah, &quot;Sister, get up, and let us pray and implore our Lord that he
grant us mercy and safety.&quot; So she got up, and they began to pray and
implore that they might be kept safe. Tobias began by saying, &quot;Blessed are
you, O God of our fathers.... You made Adam, and for him you made his wife Eve
as a helper and support. From the two of them the race of mankind has sprung.
You said, 'It is not good that the man should be alone; let us make a helper
for him like himself.' I now am taking this kinswoman of mine, not because of
lust, but with sincerity. Grant that she and I may find mercy and that we may
grow old together.&quot; and they both said, &quot;Amen, Amen.&quot; Then they
went to sleep for the night.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2E7 href="__P86.HTM#$2E7">143</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2362
&quot;The acts in marriage by which the intimate and chaste union of the
spouses takes place are noble and honorable; the truly human performance of
these acts fosters the self-giving they signify and enriches the spouses in joy
and gratitude.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2E8 href="__P86.HTM#$2E8">144</a></sup></font> Sexuality is a source of joy and pleasure:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>The Creator himself . . .
established that in the [generative] function, spouses should experience
pleasure and enjoyment of body and spirit. Therefore, the spouses do nothing
evil in seeking this pleasure and enjoyment. They accept what the Creator has
intended for them. At the same time, spouses should know how to keep themselves
within the limits of just moderation.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2E9 href="__P86.HTM#$2E9">145</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2363
The spouses' union achieves the twofold end of marriage: the good of the
spouses themselves and the transmission of life. These two meanings or values
of marriage cannot be separated without altering the couple's spiritual life
and compromising the goods of marriage and the future of the family. <br>
The conjugal love of man and woman thus stands under the twofold obligation of
fidelity and fecundity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Conjugal
fidelity</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2364
The married couple forms &quot;the intimate partnership of life and love established
by the Creator and governed by his laws; it is rooted in the conjugal covenant,
that is, in their irrevocable personal consent.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2EA href="__P86.HTM#$2EA">146</a></sup></font> Both give
themselves definitively and totally to one another. They are no longer two;
from now on they form one flesh. the covenant they freely contracted imposes on
the spouses the obligation to preserve it as unique and
indissoluble.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2EB href="__P86.HTM#$2EB">147</a></sup></font> &quot;What therefore God has joined together, let not
man put asunder.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2EC href="__P86.HTM#$2EC">148</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2365
Fidelity expresses constancy in keeping one's given word. God is faithful. the
Sacrament of Matrimony enables man and woman to enter into Christ's fidelity
for his Church. Through conjugal chastity, they bear witness to this mystery
before the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. John Chrysostom suggests that young husbands should say to their
wives: I have taken you in my arms, and I love you, and I prefer you to my life
itself. For the present life is nothing, and my most ardent dream is to spend
it with you in such a way that we may be assured of not being separated in the
life reserved for us.... I place your love above all things, and nothing would
be more bitter or painful to me than to be of a different mind than
you.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2ED href="__P86.HTM#$2ED">149</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The
fecundity of marriage</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2366
Fecundity is a gift, an end of marriage, for conjugal love naturally tends to
be fruitful. A child does not come from outside as something added on to the
mutual love of the spouses, but springs from the very heart of that mutual
giving, as its fruit and fulfillment. So the Church, which &quot;is on the side
of life&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2EE href="__P86.HTM#$2EE">150</a></sup></font> teaches that &quot;each and every marriage act must
remain open 'per se' to the transmission of life.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2EF href="__P86.HTM#$2EF">151</a></sup></font> &quot;This
particular doctrine, expounded on numerous occasions by the Magisterium, is
based on the inseparable connection, established by God, which man on his own
initiative may not break, between the unitive significance and the procreative
significance which are both inherent to the marriage act.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2EG href="__P86.HTM#$2EG">152</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2367
Called to give life, spouses share in the creative power and fatherhood of
God.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2EH href="__P86.HTM#$2EH">153</a></sup></font> &quot;Married couples should regard it as their proper mission
to transmit human life and to educate their children; they should realize that
they are thereby cooperating with the love of God the Creator and are, in a
certain sense, its interpreters. They will fulfill this duty with a sense of
human and Christian responsibility.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2EI href="__P86.HTM#$2EI">154</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2368
A particular aspect of this responsibility concerns the regulation of procreation.
For just reasons, spouses may wish to space the births of their children. It is
their duty to make certain that their desire is not motivated by selfishness
but is in conformity with the generosity appropriate to responsible parenthood.
Moreover, they should conform their behavior to the objective criteria of
morality:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>When it is a question of
harmonizing married love with the responsible transmission of life, the
morality of the behavior does not depend on sincere intention and evaluation of
motives alone; but it must be determined by objective criteria, criteria drawn
from the nature of the person and his acts criteria that respect the total
meaning of mutual self-giving and human procreation in the context of true
love; this is possible only if the virtue of married chastity is practiced with
sincerity of heart.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2EJ href="__P86.HTM#$2EJ">155</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2369
&quot;By safeguarding both these essential aspects, the unitive and the
procreative, the conjugal act preserves in its fullness the sense of true
mutual love and its orientation toward man's exalted vocation to
parenthood.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2EK href="__P86.HTM#$2EK">156</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2370
Periodic continence, that is, the methods of birth regulation based on
self-observation and the use of infertile periods, is in conformity with the
objective criteria of morality.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2EL href="__P86.HTM#$2EL">157</a></sup></font> These methods respect the bodies of
the spouses, encourage tenderness between them, and favor the education of an
authentic freedom. In contrast, &quot;every action which, whether in
anticipation of the conjugal act, or in its accomplishment, or in the
development of its natural consequences, proposes, whether as an end or as a
means, to render procreation impossible&quot; is intrinsically evil:<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2EM href="__P86.HTM#$2EM">158</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>Thus the innate language that
expresses the total reciprocal self-giving of husband and wife is overlaid,
through contraception, by an objectively contradictory language, namely, that
of not giving oneself totally to the other. This leads not only to a positive
refusal to be open to life but also to a falsification of the inner truth of
conjugal love, which is called upon to give itself in personal totality.... the
difference, both anthropological and moral, between contraception and recourse
to the rhythm of the cycle . . . involves in the final analysis two
irreconcilable concepts of the human person and of human sexuality.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2EN href="__P86.HTM#$2EN">159</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2371
&quot;Let all be convinced that human life and the duty of transmitting it are
not limited by the horizons of this life only: their true evaluation and full
significance can be understood only in reference to man's eternal
destiny.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2EO href="__P86.HTM#$2EO">160</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2372
The state has a responsibility for its citizens' well-being. In this capacity
it is legitimate for it to intervene to orient the demography of the
population. This can be done by means of objective and respectful information,
but certainly not by authoritarian, coercive measures. the state may not
legitimately usurp the initiative of spouses, who have the primary
responsibility for the procreation and education of their children.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2EP href="__P86.HTM#$2EP">161</a></sup></font>
It is not authorized to intervene in this area with means contrary to the moral
law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The gift of
a child</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2373
Sacred Scripture and the Church's traditional practice see in large families a
sign of God's blessing and the parents' generosity.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2EQ href="__P86.HTM#$2EQ">162</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2374
Couples who discover that they are sterile suffer greatly. &quot;What will you
give me,&quot; asks Abraham of God, &quot;for I continue
childless?&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2ER href="__P86.HTM#$2ER">163</a></sup></font> and Rachel cries to her husband Jacob, &quot;Give
me children, or I shall die!&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2ES href="__P86.HTM#$2ES">164</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2375
Research aimed at reducing human sterility is to be encouraged, on condition
that it is placed &quot;at the service of the human person, of his inalienable
rights, and his true and integral good according to the design and will of
God.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2ET href="__P86.HTM#$2ET">165</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2376
Techniques
that entail the dissociation of husband and wife, by the intrusion of a person
other than the couple (donation of sperm or ovum, surrogate uterus), are gravely
immoral. These techniques (heterologous artificial insemination and
fertilization) infringe the child's right to be born of a father and mother
known to him and bound to each other by marriage. They betray the spouses'
&quot;right to become a father and a mother only through each
other.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2EU href="__P86.HTM#$2EU">166</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2377
Techniques
involving only the married couple (homologous artificial insemination and
fertilization) are perhaps less reprehensible, yet remain morally unacceptable.
They dissociate the sexual act from the procreative act. the act which brings
the child into existence is no longer an act by which two persons give
themselves to one another, but one that &quot;entrusts the life and identity of
the embryo into the power of doctors and biologists and establishes the
domination of technology over the origin and destiny of the human person. Such
a relationship of domination is in itself contrary to the dignity and equality
that must be common to parents and children.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2EV href="__P86.HTM#$2EV">167</a></sup></font> &quot;Under the
moral aspect procreation is deprived of its proper perfection when it is not
willed as the fruit of the conjugal act, that is to say, of the specific act of
the spouses' union .... Only respect for the link between the meanings of the
conjugal act and respect for the unity of the human being make possible
procreation in conformity with the dignity of the person.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2EW href="__P86.HTM#$2EW">168</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2378
A child is not something owed to one, but is a gift. the &quot;supreme gift of
marriage&quot; is a human person. A child may not be considered a piece of
property, an idea to which an alleged &quot;right to a child&quot; would lead.
In this area, only the child possesses genuine rights: the right &quot;to be
the fruit of the specific act of the conjugal love of his parents,&quot; and &quot;the
right to be respected as a person from the moment of his
conception.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2EX href="__P86.HTM#$2EX">169</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2379
The Gospel shows that physical sterility is not an absolute evil. Spouses who
still suffer from infertility after exhausting legitimate medical procedures
should unite themselves with the Lord's Cross, the source of all spiritual
fecundity. They can give expression to their generosity by adopting abandoned
children or performing demanding services for others.</p>
