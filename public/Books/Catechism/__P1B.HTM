<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Paragraph 6. MAN</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>355
&quot;God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him,
male and female he created them.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-CA href="__P1B.HTM#$CA">218</a></sup></font> Man occupies a unique place
in creation: (I) he is &quot;in the image of God&quot;; (II) in his own nature
he unites the spiritual and material worlds; (III) he is created &quot;male and
female&quot;; (IV) God established him in his friendship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I. &quot;IN
THE IMAGE OF GOD&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>356
Of all visible creatures only man is &quot;able to know and love his
creator&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-CB href="__P1B.HTM#$CB">219</a></sup></font> He is &quot;the only creature on earth that God has
willed for himself&quot;,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-CC href="__P1B.HTM#$CC">220</a></sup></font> and he alone is called to share, by
knowledge and love, in God's own life. It was for this end that he was created,
and this is the fundamental reason for his dignity: <br>
What
made you establish man in so great a dignity? Certainly the incalculable love
by which you have looked on your creature in yourself! You are taken with love
for her; for by love indeed you created her, by love you have given her a being
capable of tasting your eternal Good.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-CD href="__P1B.HTM#$CD">221</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>357
Being in the image of God the human individual possesses the dignity of a
person, who is not just something, but someone. He is capable of
self-knowledge, of self-possession and of freely giving himself and entering
into communion with other persons. and he is called by grace to a covenant with
his Creator, to offer him a response of faith and love that no other creature
can give in his stead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>358
God created everything for man,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-CE href="__P1B.HTM#$CE">222</a></sup></font> but man in turn was created to serve
and love God and to offer all creation back to him: <br>
What is it that is about to be created, that enjoys such honour? It is man that
great and wonderful living creature, more precious in the eyes of God than all
other creatures! For him the heavens and the earth, the sea and all the rest of
creation exist. God attached so much importance to his salvation that he did
not spare his own Son for the sake of man. Nor does he ever cease to work,
trying every possible means, until he has raised man up to himself and made him
sit at his right hand.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-CF href="__P1B.HTM#$CF">223</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>359
&quot;In reality it is only in the mystery of the Word made flesh that the
mystery of man truly becomes clear.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-CG href="__P1B.HTM#$CG">224</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>St. Paul tells us that the
human race takes its origin from two men: Adam and Christ. . . the first man, Adam,
he says, became a living soul, the last Adam a life-giving spirit. the first
Adam was made by the last Adam, from whom he also received his soul, to give
him life... the second Adam stamped his image on the first Adam when he created
him. That is why he took on himself the role and the name of the first Adam, in
order that he might not lose what he had made in his own image. the first Adam,
the last Adam: the first had a beginning, the last knows no end. the last Adam
is indeed the first; as he himself says: &quot;I am the first and the
last.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-CH href="__P1B.HTM#$CH">225</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>360
Because of its common origin the human race forms a unity, for &quot;from one
ancestor (God) made all nations to inhabit the whole earth&quot;:<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-CI href="__P1B.HTM#$CI">226</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>O wondrous vision, which makes
us contemplate the human race in the unity of its origin in God. . . in the
unity of its nature, composed equally in all men of a material body and a
spiritual soul; in the unity of its immediate end and its mission in the world;
in the unity of its dwelling, the earth, whose benefits all men, by right of
nature, may use to sustain and develop life; in the unity of its supernatural
end: God himself, to whom all ought to tend; in the unity of the means for
attaining this end;. . . in the unity of the redemption wrought by Christ for
all.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-CJ href="__P1B.HTM#$CJ">227</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>361
&quot;This law of human solidarity and charity&quot;,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-CK href="__P1B.HTM#$CK">228</a></sup></font> without
excluding the rich variety of persons, cultures and peoples, assures us that
all men are truly brethren.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>II.
&quot;BODY AND SOUL BUT TRULY ONE&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>362
The human person, created in the image of God, is a being at once corporeal and
spiritual. the biblical account expresses this reality in symbolic language
when it affirms that &quot;then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground,
and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living
being.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-CL href="__P1B.HTM#$CL">229</a></sup></font> Man, whole and entire, is therefore willed by God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>363
In Sacred Scripture the term &quot;soul&quot; often refers to human life or the
entire human person.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-CM href="__P1B.HTM#$CM">230</a></sup></font> But &quot;soul&quot; also refers to the
innermost aspect of man, that which is of greatest value in him,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-CN href="__P1B.HTM#$CN">231</a></sup></font>
that by which he is most especially in God's image: &quot;soul&quot; signifies
the spiritual principle in man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>364
The human body shares in the dignity of &quot;the image of God&quot;: it is a
human body precisely because it is animated by a spiritual soul, and it is the
whole human person that is intended to become, in the body of Christ, a temple
of the Spirit:<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-CO href="__P1B.HTM#$CO">232</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>Man, though made of body and
soul, is a unity. Through his very bodily condition he sums up in himself the
elements of the material world. Through him they are thus brought to their
highest perfection and can raise their voice in praise freely given to the
Creator. For this reason man may not despise his bodily life. Rather he is
obliged to regard his body as good and to hold it in honour since God has
created it and will raise it up on the last day <font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-CP href="__P1B.HTM#$CP">233</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>365
The unity of soul and body is so profound that one has to consider the soul to
be the &quot;form&quot; of the body:<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-CQ href="__P1B.HTM#$CQ">234</a></sup></font> i.e., it is because of its
spiritual soul that the body made of matter becomes a living, human body;
spirit and matter, in man, are not two natures united, but rather their union
forms a single nature.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>366
The Church teaches that every spiritual soul is created immediately by God - it
is not &quot;produced&quot; by the parents - and also that it is immortal: it
does not perish when it separates from the body at death, and it will be
reunited with the body at the final Resurrection.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-CR href="__P1B.HTM#$CR">235</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>367
Sometimes the soul is distinguished from the spirit: St. Paul for instance
prays that God may sanctify his people &quot;wholly&quot;, with &quot;spirit
and soul and body&quot; kept sound and blameless at the Lord's
coming.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-CS href="__P1B.HTM#$CS">236</a></sup></font> The Church teaches that this distinction does not introduce
a duality into the soul.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-CT href="__P1B.HTM#$CT">237</a></sup></font> &quot;Spirit&quot; signifies that from
creation man is ordered to a supernatural end and that his soul can gratuitously
be raised beyond all it deserves to communion with God.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-CU href="__P1B.HTM#$CU">238</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>368
The spiritual tradition of the Church also emphasizes the heart, in the
biblical sense of the depths of one's being, where the person decides for or
against God.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-CV href="__P1B.HTM#$CV">239</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>III.
&quot;MALE AND FEMALE HE CREATED THEM&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Equality
and difference willed by God</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>369
Man
and woman have been created, which is to say, willed by God: on the one hand,
in perfect equality as human persons; on the other, in their respective beings
as man and woman. &quot;Being man&quot; or &quot;being woman&quot; is a reality
which is good and willed by God: man and woman possess an inalienable dignity
which comes to them immediately from God their Creator.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-CW href="__P1B.HTM#$CW">240</a></sup></font> Man and
woman are both with one and the same dignity &quot;in the image of God&quot;.
In their &quot;being-man&quot; and &quot;being-woman&quot;, they reflect the
Creator's wisdom and goodness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>370
In no way is God in man's image. He is neither man nor woman. God is pure
spirit in which there is no place for the difference between the sexes. But the
respective &quot;perfections&quot; of man and woman reflect something of the
infinite perfection of God: those of a mother and those of a father and
husband.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-CX href="__P1B.HTM#$CX">241</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Each
for the other&quot; - &quot;A unity in two&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>371
God created man and woman together and willed each for the other. the Word of
God gives us to understand this through various features of the sacred text.
&quot;It is not good that the man should be alone. I will make him a helper fit
for him.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-CY href="__P1B.HTM#$CY">242</a></sup></font> None of the animals can be man's partner.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-CZ href="__P1B.HTM#$CZ">243</a></sup></font>
The woman God &quot;fashions&quot; from the man's rib and brings to him elicits
on the man's part a cry of wonder, an exclamation of love and communion:
&quot;This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-D0 href="__P1B.HTM#$D0">244</a></sup></font>
Man discovers woman as another &quot;I&quot;, sharing the same humanity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>372
Man and woman were made &quot;for each other&quot; - not that God left them
half-made and incomplete: he created them to be a communion of persons, in
which each can be &quot;helpmate&quot; to the other, for they are equal as
persons (&quot;bone of my bones. . .&quot;) and complementary as masculine and
feminine. In marriage God unites them in such a way that, by forming &quot;one
flesh&quot;,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-D1 href="__P1B.HTM#$D1">245</a></sup></font> they can transmit human life: &quot;Be fruitful and multiply,
and fill the earth.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-D2 href="__P1B.HTM#$D2">246</a></sup></font> By transmitting human life to their
descendants, man and woman as spouses and parents co-operate in a unique way in
the Creator's work.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-D3 href="__P1B.HTM#$D3">247</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>373
In God's plan man and woman have the vocation of &quot;subduing&quot; the
earth<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-D4 href="__P1B.HTM#$D4">248</a></sup></font> as stewards of God. This sovereignty is not to be an arbitrary
and destructive domination. God calls man and woman, made in the image of the
Creator &quot;who loves everything that exists&quot;,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-D5 href="__P1B.HTM#$D5">249</a></sup></font> to share in
his providence toward other creatures; hence their responsibility for the world
God has entrusted to them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>IV. MAN IN
PARADISE</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>374
The first man was not only created good, but was also established in friendship
with his Creator and in harmony with himself and with the creation around him,
in a state that would be surpassed only by the glory of the new creation in
Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>375
The Church, interpreting the symbolism of biblical language in an authentic
way, in the light of the New Testament and Tradition, teaches that our first
parents, Adam and Eve, were constituted in an original &quot;state of holiness
and justice&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-D6 href="__P1B.HTM#$D6">250</a></sup></font> This grace of original holiness was &quot;to
share in. . .divine life&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-D7 href="__P1B.HTM#$D7">251</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>376
By the radiance of this grace all dimensions of man's life were confirmed. As
long as he remained in the divine intimacy, man would not have to suffer or
die.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-D8 href="__P1B.HTM#$D8">252</a></sup></font> The inner harmony of the human person, the harmony between man
and woman,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-D9 href="__P1B.HTM#$D9">253</a></sup></font> and finally the harmony between the first couple and all
creation, comprised the state called &quot;original justice&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>377
The &quot;mastery&quot; over the world that God offered man from the beginning
was realized above all within man himself: mastery of self. the first man was
unimpaired and ordered in his whole being because he was free from the triple
concupiscence<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-DA href="__P1B.HTM#$DA">254</a></sup></font> that subjugates him to the pleasures of the senses,
covetousness for earthly goods, and self-assertion, contrary to the dictates of
reason.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>378
The sign of man's familiarity with God is that God places him in the
garden.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-DB href="__P1B.HTM#$DB">255</a></sup></font> There he lives &quot;to till it and keep it&quot;. Work is
not yet a burden,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-DC href="__P1B.HTM#$DC">256</a></sup></font> but rather the collaboration of man and woman with
God in perfecting the visible creation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>379
This entire harmony of original justice, foreseen for man in God's plan, will
be lost by the sin of our first parents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>IN BRIEF</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>380 &quot;Father,. . . you formed

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>381 Man is predestined to
