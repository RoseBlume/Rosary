<p class=MsoNormal>1987
The grace of the Holy Spirit has the power to justify us, that is, to cleanse
us from our sins and to communicate to us &quot;the righteousness of God
through faith in Jesus Christ&quot; and through Baptism:<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-248 href="__P6Y.HTM#$248">34</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>But if we have died with
Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him. For we know that Christ
being raised from the dead will never die again; death no longer has dominion
over him. the death he died he died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives
he lives to God. So you also must consider yourselves as dead to sin and alive
to God in Christ Jesus.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-249 href="__P6Y.HTM#$249">35</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1988
Through the power of the Holy Spirit we take part in Christ's Passion by dying
to sin, and in his Resurrection by being born to a new life; we are members of
his Body which is the Church, branches grafted onto the vine which is
himself:<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-24A href="__P6Y.HTM#$24A">36</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>(God) gave himself to us
through his Spirit. By the participation of the Spirit, we become communicants
in the divine nature.... For this reason, those in whom the Spirit dwells are
divinized.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-24B href="__P6Y.HTM#$24B">37</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1989
The first work of the grace of the Holy Spirit is conversion, effecting
justification in accordance with Jesus' proclamation at the beginning of the
Gospel: &quot;Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-24C href="__P6Y.HTM#$24C">38</a></sup></font>
Moved by grace, man turns toward God and away from sin, thus accepting
forgiveness and righteousness from on high. &quot;Justification is not only the
remission of sins, but also the sanctification and renewal of the interior
man.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-24D href="__P6Y.HTM#$24D">39</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1990
Justification detaches man from sin which contradicts the love of God, and
purifies his heart of sin. Justification follows upon God's merciful initiative
of offering forgiveness. It reconciles man with God. It frees from the
enslavement to sin, and it heals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1991
Justification is at the same time the acceptance of God's righteousness through
faith in Jesus Christ. Righteousness (or &quot;justice&quot;) here means the
rectitude of divine love. With justification, faith, hope, and charity are
poured into our hearts, and obedience to the divine will is granted us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1992
Justification has been merited for us by the Passion of Christ who offered
himself on the cross as a living victim, holy and pleasing to God, and whose
blood has become the instrument of atonement for the sins of all men.
Justification is conferred in Baptism, the sacrament of faith. It conforms us
to the righteousness of God, who makes us inwardly just by the power of his
mercy. Its purpose is the glory of God and of Christ, and the gift of eternal
life:<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-24E href="__P6Y.HTM#$24E">40</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>But now the righteousness of
God has been manifested apart from law, although the law and the prophets bear
witness to it, the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all
who believe. For there is no distinction: since all have sinned and fall short
of the glory of God, they are justified by his grace as a gift, through the
redemption which is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as an expiation by
his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness,
because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins; it was to
prove at the present time that he himself is righteous and that he justifies
him who has faith in Jesus.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-24F href="__P6Y.HTM#$24F">41</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1993
Justification establishes cooperation between God's grace and man's freedom. On
man's part it is expressed by the assent of faith to the Word of God, which
invites him to conversion, and in the cooperation of charity with the prompting
of the Holy Spirit who precedes and preserves his assent:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>When God touches man's heart
through the illumination of the Holy Spirit, man himself is not inactive while receiving
that inspiration, since he could reject it; and yet, without God's grace, he
cannot by his own free will move himself toward justice in God's
sight.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-24G href="__P6Y.HTM#$24G">42</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1994
Justification is the most excellent work of God's love made manifest in Christ
Jesus and granted by the Holy Spirit. It is the opinion of St. Augustine that
&quot;the justification of the wicked is a greater work than the creation of
heaven and earth,&quot; because &quot;heaven and earth will pass away but the
salvation and justification of the elect . . . will not pass
away.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-24H href="__P6Y.HTM#$24H">43</a></sup></font> He holds also that the justification of sinners surpasses
the creation of the angels in justice, in that it bears witness to a greater
mercy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1995
The Holy Spirit is the master of the interior life. By giving birth to the
&quot;inner man,&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-24I href="__P6Y.HTM#$24I">44</a></sup></font> justification entails the sanctification of
his whole being:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>Just as you once yielded your
members to impurity and to greater and greater iniquity, so now yield your
members to righteousness for sanctification.... But now that you have been set
free from sin and have become slaves of God, the return you get is
sanctification and its end, eternal life.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-24J href="__P6Y.HTM#$24J">45</a></sup></font></p>
