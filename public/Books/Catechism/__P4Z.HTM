<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>IN BRIEF</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>1590 St. Paul said to his
disciple Timothy: &quot;I remind you to rekindle the gift of God that is within
you through the laying on of my hands&quot; (2Tim
1:6), and &quot;If any one aspires to the office of bishop, he
desires a noble task.&quot; (1 Tim 3:1) To
Titus he said: &quot;This is why I left you in Crete, that you amend what was
defective, and appoint presbyters in every town, as I directed you&quot; (Titus
1:5).</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>1591 The whole Church is a
priestly people. Through Baptism all the faithful share in the priesthood of
Christ. This participation is called the &quot;common priesthood of the
faithful.&quot; Based on this common priesthood and ordered to its service,
there exists another participation in the mission of Christ: the ministry
conferred by the sacrament of Holy Orders, where the task is to serve in the
name and in the person of Christ the Head in the midst of the community.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>1592 The ministerial
priesthood differs in essence from the common priesthood of the faithful
because it confers a sacred power for the service of the faithful. the ordained
ministers exercise their service for the People of God by teaching (munus
docendi), divine worship (munus liturgicum) and pastoral governance (munus
regendi).</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>1593 Since the beginning, the
ordained ministry has been conferred and exercised in three degrees: that of
bishops, that of presbyters, and that of deacons. the ministries conferred by
ordination are irreplaceable for the organic structure of the Church: without
the bishop, presbyters, and deacons, one cannot speak of the Church (cf St.
Ignatius of Antioch, Ad Trall. 3,1).</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>1594 The bishop receives the
fullness of the sacrament of Holy Orders, which integrates him into the
episcopal college and makes him the visible head of the particular Church
entrusted to him. As successors of the apostles and members of the college, the
bishops share in the apostolic responsibility and mission of the whole Church
under the authority of the Pope, successor of St. Peter.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>1595 Priests are united with
the bishops in sacerdotal dignity and at the same time depend on them in the
exercise of their pastoral functions; they are called to be the bishops'
prudent co-workers. They form around their bishop the presbyterium which bears
responsibility with him for the particular Church. They receive from the bishop
the charge of a parish community or a determinate ecclesial office.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>1596 Deacons are ministers
ordained for tasks of service of the Church; they do not receive the
ministerial priesthood, but ordination confers on them important functions in
the ministry of the word, divine worship, pastoral governance, and the service
of charity, tasks which they must carry out under the pastoral authority of
their bishop.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>1597 The sacrament of Holy
Orders is conferred by the laying on of hands followed by a solemn prayer of
consecration asking God to grant the ordinand the graces of the Holy Spirit
required for his ministry. Ordination imprints an indelible sacramental
character.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>1598 The Church confers the
sacrament of Holy Orders only on baptized men (viri), whose suitability for the
exercise of the ministry has been duly recognized. Church authority alone has
the responsibility and right to call someone to receive the sacrament of Holy
Orders.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>1599 In the Latin Church the
sacrament of Holy Orders for the presbyterate is normally conferred only on
candidates who are ready to embrace celibacy freely and who publicly manifest
their intention of staying celibate for the love of God's kingdom and the
service of men.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>1600 It is bishops who confer
the sacrament of Holy Orders in the three degrees.</i></p>
