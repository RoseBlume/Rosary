<p class=MsoNormal>1471
The doctrine and practice of indulgences in the Church are closely linked to
the effects of the sacrament of Penance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What is an
indulgence?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;An indulgence is a remission before God of the temporal punishment
due to sins whose guilt has already been forgiven, which the faithful Christian
who is duly disposed gains under certain prescribed conditions through the
action of the Church which, as the minister of redemption, dispenses and
applies with authority the treasury of the satisfactions of Christ and the
saints.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1Q9 href="__P4G.HTM#$1Q9">81</a></sup></font>
<br>
&quot;An
indulgence is partial or plenary according as it removes either part or all of
the temporal punishment due to sin.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1QA href="__P4G.HTM#$1QA">82</a></sup></font> Indulgences may be applied
to the living or the dead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The
punishments of sin</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1472
To
understand this doctrine and practice of the Church, it is necessary to
understand that sin has a double consequence. Grave sin deprives us of
communion with God and therefore makes us incapable of eternal life, the
privation of which is called the &quot;eternal punishment&quot; of sin. On the
other hand every sin, even venial, entails an unhealthy attachment to
creatures, which must be purified either here on earth, or after death in the
state called Purgatory. This purification frees one from what is called the
&quot;temporal punishment&quot; of sin. These two punishments must not be
conceived of as a kind of vengeance inflicted by God from without, but as
following from the very nature of sin. A conversion which proceeds from a
fervent charity can attain the complete purification of the sinner in such a
way that no punishment would remain.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1QB href="__P4G.HTM#$1QB">83</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1473
The
forgiveness of sin and restoration of communion with God entail the remission of
the eternal punishment of sin, but temporal punishment of sin remains. While
patiently bearing sufferings and trials of all kinds and, when the day comes,
serenely facing death, the Christian must strive to accept this temporal
punishment of sin as a grace. He should strive by works of mercy and charity,
as well as by prayer and the various practices of penance, to put off
completely the &quot;old man&quot; and to put on the &quot;new
man.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1QC href="__P4G.HTM#$1QC">84</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the
Communion of Saints</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1474
The
Christian who seeks to purify himself of his sin and to become holy with the
help of God's grace is not alone. &quot;The life of each of God's children is
joined in Christ and through Christ in a wonderful way to the life of all the
other Christian brethren in the supernatural unity of the Mystical Body of
Christ, as in a single mystical person.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1QD href="__P4G.HTM#$1QD">85</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1475
In the
communion of saints, &quot;a perennial link of charity exists between the
faithful who have already reached their heavenly home, those who are expiating
their sins in purgatory and those who are still pilgrims on earth. between them
there is, too, an abundant exchange of all good things.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1QE href="__P4G.HTM#$1QE">86</a></sup></font> In this
wonderful exchange, the holiness of one profits others, well beyond the harm
that the sin of one could cause others. Thus recourse to the communion of
saints lets the contrite sinner be more promptly and efficaciously purified of
the punishments for sin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1476
We
also call these spiritual goods of the communion of saints the Church's treasury,
which is &quot;not the sum total of the material goods which have accumulated
during the course of the centuries. On the contrary the 'treasury of the
Church' is the infinite value, which can never be exhausted, which Christ's
merits have before God. They were offered so that the whole of mankind could be
set free from sin and attain communion with the Father. In Christ, the Redeemer
himself, the satisfactions and merits of his Redemption exist and find their
effficacy.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1QF href="__P4G.HTM#$1QF">87</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1477
&quot;This
treasury includes as well the prayers and good works of the Blessed Virgin
Mary. They are truly immense, unfathomable, and even pristine in their value
before God. In the treasury, too, are the prayers and good works of all the
saints, all those who have followed in the footsteps of Christ the Lord and by
his grace have made their lives holy and carried out the mission the Father
entrusted to them. In this way they attained their own salvation and at the
same time cooperated in saving their brothers in the unity of the Mystical
Body.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1QG href="__P4G.HTM#$1QG">88</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Obtaining
indulgence from God through the Church</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1478
An
indulgence is obtained through the Church who, by virtue of the power of binding
and loosing granted her by Christ Jesus, intervenes in favor of individual
Christians and opens for them the treasury of the merits of Christ and the
saints to obtain from the Father of mercies the remission of the temporal
punishments due for their sins. Thus the Church does not want simply to come to
the aid of these Christians, but also to spur them to works of devotion,
penance, and charity.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1QH href="__P4G.HTM#$1QH">89</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1479
Since
the faithful departed now being purified are also members of the same communion
of saints, one way we can help them is to obtain indulgences for them, so that
the temporal punishments due for their sins may be remitted.</p>
