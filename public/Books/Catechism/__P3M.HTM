<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>VI. </b><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>The Necessity of
Baptism</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1257
The Lord himself affirms that Baptism is necessary for salvation.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1IU href="__P3M.HTM#$1IU">59</a></sup></font> He
also commands his disciples to proclaim the Gospel to all nations and to
baptize them.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1IV href="__P3M.HTM#$1IV">60</a></sup></font> Baptism is necessary for salvation for those to whom
the Gospel has been proclaimed and who have had the possibility of asking for
this sacrament.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1IW href="__P3M.HTM#$1IW">61</a></sup></font> The Church does not know of any means other than
Baptism that assures entry into eternal beatitude; this is why she takes care
not to neglect the mission she has received from the Lord to see that all who
can be baptized are &quot;reborn of water and the Spirit.&quot; God has bound
salvation to the sacrament of Baptism, but he himself is not bound by his
sacraments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1258
The Church has always held the firm conviction that those who suffer death for
the sake of the faith without having received Baptism are baptized by their
death for and with Christ. This Baptism of blood, like the desire for Baptism,
brings about the fruits of Baptism without being a sacrament.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1259
For catechumens who die before their Baptism, their explicit desire to receive
it, together with repentance for their sins, and charity, assures them the
salvation that they were not able to receive through the sacrament.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1260
&quot;Since Christ died for all, and since all men are in fact called to one
and the same destiny, which is divine, we must hold that the Holy Spirit offers
to all the possibility of being made partakers, in a way known to God, of the
Paschal mystery.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1IX href="__P3M.HTM#$1IX">62</a></sup></font> Every man who is ignorant of the Gospel of
Christ and of his Church, but seeks the truth and does the will of God in
accordance with his understanding of it, can be saved. It may be supposed that
such persons would have desired Baptism explicitly if they had known its
necessity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1261
As regards children who have died without Baptism, the Church can only entrust
them to the mercy of God, as she does in her funeral rites for them. Indeed,
the great mercy of God who desires that all men should be saved, and Jesus'
tenderness toward children which caused him to say: &quot;Let the children come
to me, do not hinder them,&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1IY href="__P3M.HTM#$1IY">63</a></sup></font> allow us to hope that there is a way
of salvation for children who have died without Baptism. All the more urgent is
the Church's call not to prevent little children coming to Christ through the gift
of holy Baptism.</p>
