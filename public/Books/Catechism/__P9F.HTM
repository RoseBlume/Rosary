<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>THE WAY OF PRAYER</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2663
In the living tradition of prayer, each Church proposes to its faithful,
according to its historic, social, and cultural context, a language for prayer:
words, melodies, gestures, iconography. the Magisterium of the Church<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2O8 href="__P9F.HTM#$2O8">15</a></sup></font>
has the task of discerning the fidelity of these ways of praying to the
tradition of apostolic faith; it is for pastors and catechists to explain their
meaning, always in relation to Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Prayer to
the Father</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2664
There is no other way of Christian prayer than Christ. Whether our prayer is
communal or personal, vocal or interior, it has access to the Father only if we
pray &quot;in the name&quot; of Jesus. the sacred humanity of Jesus is
therefore the way by which the Holy Spirit teaches us to pray to God our
Father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Prayer to
Jesus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2665
The prayer of the Church, nourished by the Word of God and the celebration of
the liturgy, teaches us to pray to the Lord Jesus. Even though her prayer is
addressed above all to the Father, it includes in all the liturgical traditions
forms of prayer addressed to Christ. Certain psalms, given their use in the
Prayer of the Church, and the New Testament place on our lips and engrave in
our hearts prayer to Christ in the form of invocations: Son of God, Word of
God, Lord, Savior, Lamb of God, King, Beloved Son, Son of the Virgin, Good
Shepherd, our Life, our Light, our Hope, our Resurrection, Friend of
mankind....</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2666
But the one name that contains everything is the one that the Son of God
received in his incarnation: JESUS. the divine name may not be spoken by human
lips, but by assuming our humanity the Word of God hands it over to us and we
can invoke it: &quot;Jesus,&quot; &quot;YHWH saves.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2O9 href="__P9F.HTM#$2O9">16</a></sup></font> The name
&quot;Jesus&quot; contains all: God and man and the whole economy of creation
and salvation. To pray &quot;Jesus&quot; is to invoke him and to call him
within us. His name is the only one that contains the presence it signifies.
Jesus is the Risen One, and whoever invokes the name of Jesus is welcoming the
Son of God who loved him and who gave himself up for him.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2OA href="__P9F.HTM#$2OA">17</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2667
This
simple invocation of faith developed in the tradition of prayer under many forms
in East and West. the most usual formulation, transmitted by the spiritual
writers of the Sinai, Syria, and Mt. Athos, is the invocation, &quot;Lord Jesus
Christ, Son of God, have mercy on us sinners.&quot; It combines the
Christological hymn of Philippians 2:6-11 with the cry of the publican and the
blind men begging for light.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2OB href="__P9F.HTM#$2OB">18</a></sup></font> By it the heart is opened to human
wretchedness and the Savior's mercy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2668
The
invocation of the holy name of Jesus is the simplest way of praying always. When
the holy name is repeated often by a humbly attentive heart, the prayer is not
lost by heaping up empty phrases,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2OC href="__P9F.HTM#$2OC">19</a></sup></font> but holds fast to the word and
&quot;brings forth fruit with patience.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2OD href="__P9F.HTM#$2OD">20</a></sup></font> This prayer is possible
&quot;at all times&quot; because it is not one occupation among others but the
only occupation: that of loving God, which animates and transfigures every
action in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2669
The
prayer of the Church venerates and honors the Heart of Jesus just as it invokes
his most holy name. It adores the incarnate Word and his Heart which, out of
love for men, he allowed to be pierced by our sins. Christian prayer loves to
follow the way of the cross in the Savior's steps. the stations from the
Praetorium to Golgotha and the tomb trace the way of Jesus, who by his holy
Cross has redeemed the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Come,
Holy Spirit&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2670
&quot;No one can say 'Jesus is Lord' except by the Holy Spirit.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2OE href="__P9F.HTM#$2OE">21</a></sup></font>
Every time we begin to pray to Jesus it is the Holy Spirit who draws us on the
way of prayer by his prevenient grace. Since he teaches us to pray by recalling
Christ, how could we not pray to the Spirit too? That is why the Church invites
us to call upon the Holy Spirit every day, especially at the beginning and the
end of every important action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the Spirit should not be worshiped, how can he divinize me through
Baptism? If he should be worshiped, should he not be the object of
adoration?<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2OF href="__P9F.HTM#$2OF">22</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2671
The traditional form of petition to the Holy Spirit is to invoke the Father
through Christ our Lord to give us the Consoler Spirit.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2OG href="__P9F.HTM#$2OG">23</a></sup></font> Jesus insists
on this petition to be made in his name at the very moment when he promises the
gift of the Spirit of Truth.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2OH href="__P9F.HTM#$2OH">24</a></sup></font> But the simplest and most direct prayer
is also traditional, &quot;Come, Holy Spirit,&quot; and every liturgical
tradition has developed it in antiphons and hymns.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>Come, Holy Spirit, fill the
hearts of your faithful and enkindle in them the fire of your love.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2OI href="__P9F.HTM#$2OI">25</a></sup></font> <br>
Heavenly King, Consoler Spirit, Spirit of Truth, present everywhere and filling
all things, treasure of all good and source of all life, come dwell in us,
cleanse and save us, you who are All Good.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2OJ href="__P9F.HTM#$2OJ">26</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2672
The Holy Spirit, whose anointing permeates our whole being, is the interior
Master of Christian prayer. He is the artisan of the living tradition of
prayer. To be sure, there are as many paths of prayer as there are persons who
pray, but it is the same Spirit acting in all and with all. It is in the
communion of the Holy Spirit that Christian prayer is prayer in the Church.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In
communion with the holy Mother of God</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2673
In prayer the Holy Spirit unites us to the person of the only Son, in his
glorified humanity, through which and in which our filial prayer unites us in
the Church with the Mother of Jesus.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2OK href="__P9F.HTM#$2OK">27</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2674
Mary gave her consent in faith at the Annunciation and maintained it without
hesitation at the foot of the Cross. Ever since, her motherhood has extended to
the brothers and sisters of her Son &quot;who still journey on earth surrounded
by dangers and difficulties.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2OL href="__P9F.HTM#$2OL">28</a></sup></font> Jesus, the only mediator, is the
way of our prayer; Mary, his mother and ours, is wholly transparent to him: she
&quot;shows the way&quot; (hodigitria), and is herself &quot;the Sign&quot; of
the way, according to the traditional iconography of East and West.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2675
Beginning with Mary's unique cooperation with the working of the Holy Spirit, the
Churches developed their prayer to the holy Mother of God, centering it on the
person of Christ manifested in his mysteries. In countless hymns and antiphons
expressing this prayer, two movements usually alternate with one another: the
first &quot;magnifies&quot; the Lord for the &quot;great things&quot; he did
for his lowly servant and through her for all human beings<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2OM href="__P9F.HTM#$2OM">29</a></sup></font> The second
entrusts the supplications and praises of the children of God to the Mother of
Jesus, because she now knows the humanity which, in her, the Son of God
espoused.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2676
This
twofold movement of prayer to Mary has found a privileged expression in the Ave
Maria: <br>
Hail Mary [or Rejoice, Mary]: the greeting of the angel Gabriel opens this
prayer. It is God himself who, through his angel as intermediary, greets Mary.
Our prayer dares to take up this greeting to Mary with the regard God had for
the lowliness of his humble servant and to exult in the joy he finds in
her.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2ON href="__P9F.HTM#$2ON">30</a></sup></font> <br>
Full of grace, the Lord is with thee: These two phrases of the angel's greeting
shed light on one another. Mary is full of grace because the Lord is with her.
the grace with which she is filled is the presence of him who is the source of
all grace. &quot;Rejoice . . . O Daughter of Jerusalem . . . the Lord your God
is in your midst.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2OO href="__P9F.HTM#$2OO">31</a></sup></font> Mary, in whom the Lord himself has just made
his dwelling, is the daughter of Zion in person, the ark of the covenant, the
place where the glory of the Lord dwells. She is &quot;the dwelling of God . .
. with men.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2OP href="__P9F.HTM#$2OP">32</a></sup></font> Full of grace, Mary is wholly given over to him who
has come to dwell in her and whom she is about to give to the world. <br>
Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. After
the angel's greeting, we make Elizabeth's greeting our own. &quot;Filled with
the Holy Spirit,&quot; Elizabeth is the first in the long succession of
generations who have called Mary &quot;blessed.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2OQ href="__P9F.HTM#$2OQ">33</a></sup></font> &quot;Blessed
is she who believed....&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2OR href="__P9F.HTM#$2OR">34</a></sup></font> Mary is &quot;blessed among women&quot;
because she believed in the fulfillment of the Lord's word. Abraham. because of
his faith, became a blessing for all the nations of the earth.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2OS href="__P9F.HTM#$2OS">35</a></sup></font> Mary,
because of her faith, became the mother of believers, through whom all nations
of the earth receive him who is God's own blessing: Jesus, the &quot;fruit of
thy womb.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2677
Holy
Mary, Mother of God: With Elizabeth we marvel, &quot;and why is this granted
me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2OT href="__P9F.HTM#$2OT">36</a></sup></font> Because she
gives us Jesus, her son, Mary is Mother of God and our mother; we can entrust
all our cares and petitions to her: she prays for us as she prayed for herself:
&quot;Let it be to me according to your word.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2OU href="__P9F.HTM#$2OU">37</a></sup></font> By entrusting
ourselves to her prayer, we abandon ourselves to the will of God together with
her: &quot;Thy will be done.&quot; <br>
Pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death: By asking Mary to pray
for us, we acknowledge ourselves to be poor sinners and we address ourselves to
the &quot;Mother of Mercy,&quot; the All-Holy One. We give ourselves over to
her now, in the Today of our lives. and our trust broadens further, already at
the present moment, to surrender &quot;the hour of our death&quot; wholly to
her care. May she be there as she was at her son's death on the cross. May she
welcome us as our mother at the hour of our passing<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2OV href="__P9F.HTM#$2OV">38</a></sup></font> to lead us to her
son, Jesus, in paradise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2678
Medieval
piety in the West developed the prayer of the rosary as a popular substitute
for the Liturgy of the Hours. In the East, the litany called the Akathistos and
the Paraclesis remained closer to the choral office in the Byzantine churches,
while the Armenian, Coptic, and Syriac traditions preferred popular hymns and
songs to the Mother of God. But in the Ave Maria, the theotokia, the hymns of
St. Ephrem or St. Gregory of Narek, the tradition of prayer is basically the
same.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2679
Mary is the perfect Orans (prayer), a figure of the Church. When we pray to
her, we are adhering with her to the plan of the Father, who sends his Son to
save all men. Like the beloved disciple we welcome Jesus' mother into our
homes,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2OW href="__P9F.HTM#$2OW">39</a></sup></font> for she has become the mother of all the living. We can pray
with and to her. the prayer of the Church is sustained by the prayer of Mary
and united with it in hope.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2OX href="__P9F.HTM#$2OX">40</a></sup></font></p>
