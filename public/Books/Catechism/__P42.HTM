<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>VI. The Paschal Banquet</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1382
The Mass is at the same time, and inseparably, the sacrificial memorial in
which the sacrifice of the cross is perpetuated and the sacred banquet of
communion with the Lord's body and blood. But the celebration of the Eucharistic
sacrifice is wholly directed toward the intimate union of the faithful with
Christ through communion. To receive communion is to receive Christ himself who
has offered himself for us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1383
The altar, around which the Church is gathered in the celebration of the
Eucharist, represents the two aspects of the same mystery: the altar of the
sacrifice and the table of the Lord. This is all the more so since the
Christian altar is the symbol of Christ himself, present in the midst of the assembly
of his faithful, both as the victim offered for our reconciliation and as food
from heaven who is giving himself to us. &quot;For what is the altar of Christ
if not the image of the Body of Christ?&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1N3 href="__P42.HTM#$1N3">212</a></sup></font> asks St. Ambrose. He
says elsewhere, &quot;The altar represents the body [of Christ] and the Body of
Christ is on the altar.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1N4 href="__P42.HTM#$1N4">213</a></sup></font> The liturgy expresses this unity of
sacrifice and communion in many prayers. Thus the Roman Church prays in its
anaphora:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>We entreat you, almighty God,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>that by the hands of your holy
Angel</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>this offering may be borne to
your altar in heaven</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>in the sight of your divine
majesty,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>so that as we receive in
communion at this altar</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>the most holy Body and Blood
of your Son,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>we may be filled with every
heavenly blessing and grace.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1N5 href="__P42.HTM#$1N5">214</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Take
this and eat it, all of you&quot;: communion</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1384
The Lord addresses an invitation to us, urging us to receive him in the
sacrament of the Eucharist: &quot;Truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh
of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in
you.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1N6 href="__P42.HTM#$1N6">215</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1385
To respond to this invitation we must prepare ourselves for so great and so
holy a moment. St. Paul urges us to examine our conscience: &quot;Whoever,
therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner
will be guilty of profaning the body and blood of the Lord. Let a man examine
himself, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For any one who eats and
drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment upon
himself.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1N7 href="__P42.HTM#$1N7">216</a></sup></font> Anyone conscious of a grave sin must receive the
sacrament of Reconciliation before coming to communion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1386
Before so great a sacrament, the faithful can only echo humbly and with ardent
faith the words of the Centurion: &quot;Domine, non sum dignus ut intres sub
tectum meum, sed tantum dic verbo, et sanabitur anima mea&quot; (&quot;Lord, I
am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my
soul will be healed.&quot;).<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1N8 href="__P42.HTM#$1N8">217</a></sup></font> and in the Divine Liturgy of St. John
Chrysostom the faithful pray in the same spirit:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>O Son of God, bring me into
communion today with your mystical supper. I shall not tell your enemies the
secret, nor kiss you with Judas' kiss. But like the good thief I cry,
&quot;Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1387
To prepare for worthy reception of this sacrament, the faithful should observe
the fast required in their Church.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1N9 href="__P42.HTM#$1N9">218</a></sup></font> Bodily demeanor (gestures,
clothing) ought to convey the respect, solemnity, and joy of this moment when
Christ becomes our guest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1388
It is in keeping with the very meaning of the Eucharist that the faithful, if
they have the required dispositions, receive communion each time they
participate in the Mass.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1NA href="__P42.HTM#$1NA">219</a></sup></font> As the Second Vatican Council says:
&quot;That more perfect form of participation in the Mass whereby the faithful,
after the priest's communion, receive the Lord's Body from the same sacrifice,
is warmly recommended.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1NB href="__P42.HTM#$1NB">220</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1389
The Church obliges the faithful &quot;to take part in the Divine Liturgy on
Sundays and feast days&quot; and, prepared by the sacrament of Reconciliation,
to receive the Eucharist at least once a year, if possible during the Easter
season.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1NC href="__P42.HTM#$1NC">221</a></sup></font> But the Church strongly encourages the faithful to receive
the holy Eucharist on Sundays and feast days, or more often still, even daily.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1390
Since Christ is sacramentally present under each of the species, communion
under the species of bread alone makes it possible to receive all the fruit of
Eucharistic grace. For pastoral reasons this manner of receiving communion has
been legitimately established as the most common form in the Latin rite. But
&quot;the sign of communion is more complete when given under both kinds, since
in that form the sign of the Eucharistic meal appears more
clearly.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1ND href="__P42.HTM#$1ND">222</a></sup></font> This is the usual form of receiving communion in the
Eastern rites.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The fruits
of Holy Communion</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1391
Holy Communion augments our union with Christ. the principal fruit of receiving
the Eucharist in Holy Communion is an intimate union with Christ Jesus. Indeed,
the Lord said: &quot;He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and
I in him.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1NE href="__P42.HTM#$1NE">223</a></sup></font> Life in Christ has its foundation in the Eucharistic
banquet: &quot;As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father,
so he who eats me will live because of me.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1NF href="__P42.HTM#$1NF">224</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>On the feasts of the Lord,
when the faithful receive the Body of the Son, they proclaim to one another the
Good News that the first fruits of life have been given, as when the angel said
to Mary Magdalene, &quot;Christ is risen!&quot; Now too are life and
resurrection conferred on whoever receives Christ.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1NG href="__P42.HTM#$1NG">225</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1392
What material food produces in our bodily life, Holy Communion wonderfully
achieves in our spiritual life. Communion with the flesh of the risen Christ, a
flesh &quot;given life and giving life through the Holy
Spirit,&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1NH href="__P42.HTM#$1NH">226</a></sup></font> preserves, increases, and renews the life of grace received
at Baptism. This growth in Christian life needs the nourishment of Eucharistic
Communion, the bread for our pilgrimage until the moment of death, when it will
be given to us as viaticum.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1393
Holy Communion separates us from sin. the body of Christ we receive in Holy
Communion is &quot;given up for us,&quot; and the blood we drink &quot;shed for
the many for the forgiveness of sins.&quot; For this reason the Eucharist
cannot unite us to Christ without at the same time cleansing us from past sins
and preserving us from future sins:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>For as often as we eat this
bread and drink the cup, we proclaim the death of the Lord. If we proclaim the
Lord's death, we proclaim the forgiveness of sins. If, as often as his blood is
poured out, it is poured for the forgiveness of sins, I should always receive
it, so that it may always forgive my sins. Because I always sin, I should
always have a remedy.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1NI href="__P42.HTM#$1NI">227</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1394
As bodily nourishment restores lost strength, so the Eucharist strengthens our
charity, which tends to be weakened in daily life; and this living charity
wipes away venial sins.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1NJ href="__P42.HTM#$1NJ">228</a></sup></font> By giving himself to us Christ revives our
love and enables us to break our disordered attachments to creatures and root
ourselves in him:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>Since Christ died for us out
of love, when we celebrate the memorial of his death at the moment of sacrifice
we ask that love may be granted to us by the coming of the Holy Spirit. We
humbly pray that in the strength of this love by which Christ willed to die for
us, we, by receiving the gift of the Holy Spirit, may be able to consider the
world as crucified for us, and to be ourselves as crucified to the world....
Having received the gift of love, let us die to sin and live for God.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1NK href="__P42.HTM#$1NK">229</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1395
By the same charity that it enkindles in us, the Eucharist preserves us from
future mortal sins. the more we share the life of Christ and progress in his
friendship, the more difficult it is to break away from him by mortal sin. the
Eucharist is not ordered to the forgiveness of mortal sins - that is proper to
the sacrament of Reconciliation. the Eucharist is properly the sacrament of
those who are in full communion with the Church.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1396
The unity of the Mystical Body: the Eucharist makes the Church. Those who
receive the Eucharist are united more closely to Christ. Through it Christ
unites them to all the faithful in one body - the Church. Communion renews,
strengthens, and deepens this incorporation into the Church, already achieved
by Baptism. In Baptism we have been called to form but one body.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1NL href="__P42.HTM#$1NL">230</a></sup></font> The
Eucharist fulfills this call: &quot;The cup of blessing which we bless, is it
not a participation in the blood of Christ? the bread which we break, is it not
a participation in the body of Christ? Because there is one bread, we who are
many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread:&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1NM href="__P42.HTM#$1NM">231</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>If you are the body and
members of Christ, then it is your sacrament that is placed on the table of the
Lord; it is your sacrament that you receive. To that which you are you respond
&quot;Amen&quot; (&quot;yes, it is true!&quot;) and by responding to it you
assent to it. For you hear the words, &quot;the Body of Christ&quot; and
respond &quot;Amen.&quot; Be then a member of the Body of Christ that your Amen
may be true.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1NN href="__P42.HTM#$1NN">232</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1397
The Eucharist commits us to the poor. To receive in truth the Body and Blood of
Christ given up for us, we must recognize Christ in the poorest, his brethren:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>You have tasted the Blood of
the Lord, yet you do not recognize your brother,.... You dishonor this table
when you do not judge worthy of sharing your food someone judged worthy to take
part in this meal.... God freed you from all your sins and invited you here,
but you have not become more merciful.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1NO href="__P42.HTM#$1NO">233</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1398
The Eucharist and the unity of Christians. Before the greatness of this mystery
St. Augustine exclaims, &quot;O sacrament of devotion! O sign of unity! O bond
of charity!&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1NP href="__P42.HTM#$1NP">234</a></sup></font> The more painful the experience of the divisions
in the Church which break the common participation in the table of the Lord,
the more urgent are our prayers to the Lord that the time of complete unity
among all who believe in him may return.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1399
The
Eastern churches that are not in full communion with the Catholic Church
celebrate the Eucharist with great love. &quot;These Churches, although
separated from us, yet possess true sacraments, above all - by apostolic
succession - the priesthood and the Eucharist, whereby they are still joined to
us in closest intimacy.&quot; A certain communion in sacris, and so in the
Eucharist, &quot;given suitable circumstances and the approval of Church
authority, is not merely possible but is encouraged.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1NQ href="__P42.HTM#$1NQ">235</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1400
Ecclesial
communities derived from the Reformation and separated from the Catholic
Church, &quot;have not preserved the proper reality of the Eucharistic mystery
in its fullness, especially because of the absence of the sacrament of Holy
Orders.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1NR href="__P42.HTM#$1NR">236</a></sup></font> It is for this reason that Eucharistic intercommunion
with these communities is not possible for the Catholic Church. However these
ecclesial communities, &quot;when they commemorate the Lord's death and
resurrection in the Holy Supper . . . profess that it signifies life in communion
with Christ and await his coming in glory.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1NS href="__P42.HTM#$1NS">237</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1401
When,
in the Ordinary's judgment, a grave necessity arises, Catholic ministers may
give the sacraments of Eucharist, Penance, and Anointing of the Sick to other
Christians not in full communion with the Catholic Church, who ask for them of
their own will, provided they give evidence of holding the Catholic faith
regarding these sacraments and possess the required dispositions.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1NT href="__P42.HTM#$1NT">238</a></sup></font></p>
