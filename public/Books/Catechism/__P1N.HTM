<p class=MsoNormal>574
From the beginning of Jesus' public ministry, certain Pharisees and partisans
of Herod together with priests and scribes agreed together to destroy
him.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-NL href="__P1N.HTM#$NL">317</a></sup></font> Because of certain acts of his expelling demons, forgiving
sins, healing on the sabbath day, his novel interpretation of the precepts of
the Law regarding purity, and his familiarity with tax collectors and public
sinners<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-NM href="__P1N.HTM#$NM">318</a></sup></font>--some ill-intentioned persons suspected Jesus of demonic
possession.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-NN href="__P1N.HTM#$NN">319</a></sup></font> He is accused of blasphemy and false prophecy, religious
crimes which the Law punished with death by stoning.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-NO href="__P1N.HTM#$NO">320</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>575
Many
of Jesus' deeds and words constituted a &quot;sign of
contradiction&quot;,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-NP href="__P1N.HTM#$NP">321</a></sup></font> but more so for the religious authorities in
Jerusalem, whom the Gospel according to John often calls simply &quot;the
Jews&quot;,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-NQ href="__P1N.HTM#$NQ">322</a></sup></font> than for the ordinary People of God.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-NR href="__P1N.HTM#$NR">323</a></sup></font> To be
sure, Christ's relations with the Pharisees were not exclusively polemical.
Some Pharisees warn him of the danger he was courting;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-NS href="__P1N.HTM#$NS">324</a></sup></font> Jesus praises
some of them, like the scribe of Mark 12:34, and dines several times at their
homes.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-NT href="__P1N.HTM#$NT">325</a></sup></font> Jesus endorses some of the teachings imparted by this
religious elite of God's people: the resurrection of the dead,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-NU href="__P1N.HTM#$NU">326</a></sup></font>
certain forms of piety (almsgiving, fasting and prayer),<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-NV href="__P1N.HTM#$NV">327</a></sup></font> The custom
of addressing God as Father, and the centrality of the commandment to love God
and neighbour.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-NW href="__P1N.HTM#$NW">328</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>576
In the eyes of many in Israel, Jesus seems to be acting against essential
institutions of the Chosen People: - submission to the whole of the Law in its
written commandments and, for the Pharisees, in the interpretation of oral
tradition; - the centrality of the Temple at Jerusalem as the holy place where
God's presence dwells in a special way; - faith in the one God whose glory no
man can share.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I. JESUS
AND THE LAW</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>577
At the beginning of the Sermon on the Mount Jesus issued a solemn warning in
which he presented God's law, given on Sinai during the first covenant, in
light of the grace of the New Covenant:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets: I have
come not to abolish but to fulfil. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth
pass away, not one letter, not one stroke of a letter, will pass from the law,
until all is accomplished. Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these
commandments, and teaches others to do the same, will be called least in the
kingdom of heaven; but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great
in the kingdom of heaven.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-NX href="__P1N.HTM#$NX">329</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>578
Jesus, Israel's Messiah and therefore the greatest in the kingdom of heaven,
was to fulfil the Law by keeping it in its all embracing detail - according to
his own words, down to &quot;the least of these commandments&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-NY href="__P1N.HTM#$NY">330</a></sup></font>
He is in fact the only one who could keep it perfectly.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-NZ href="__P1N.HTM#$NZ">331</a></sup></font> On their own
admission the Jews were never able to observe the Law in its entirety without
violating the least of its precepts.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-O0 href="__P1N.HTM#$O0">332</a></sup></font> This is why every year on the
Day of Atonement the children of Israel ask God's forgiveness for their
transgressions of the Law. the Law indeed makes up one inseparable whole, and
St. James recalls, &quot;Whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has
become guilty of all of it.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-O1 href="__P1N.HTM#$O1">333</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>579
This
principle of integral observance of the Law not only in letter but in spirit
was dear to the Pharisees. By giving Israel this principle they had led many
Jews of Jesus' time to an extreme religious zeal.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-O2 href="__P1N.HTM#$O2">334</a></sup></font> This zeal, were it
not to lapse into &quot;hypocritical&quot; casuistry,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-O3 href="__P1N.HTM#$O3">335</a></sup></font> could only
prepare the People for the unprecedented intervention of God through the
perfect fulfilment of the Law by the only Righteous One in place of all sinners.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-O4 href="__P1N.HTM#$O4">336</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>580
The perfect fulfilment of the Law could be the work of none but the divine
legislator, born subject to the Law in the person of the Son.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-O5 href="__P1N.HTM#$O5">337</a></sup></font> In
Jesus, the Law no longer appears engraved on tables of stone but &quot;upon the
heart&quot; of the Servant who becomes &quot;a covenant to the people&quot;,
because he will &quot;faithfully bring forth justice&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-O6 href="__P1N.HTM#$O6">338</a></sup></font> Jesus
fulfils the Law to the point of taking upon himself &quot;the curse of the
Law&quot; incurred by those who do not &quot;abide by the things written in the
book of the Law, and do them&quot;, for his death took place to redeem them
&quot;from the transgressions under the first covenant&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-O7 href="__P1N.HTM#$O7">339</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>581
The
Jewish people and their spiritual leaders viewed Jesus as a rabbi.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-O8 href="__P1N.HTM#$O8">340</a></sup></font>
He often argued within the framework of rabbinical interpretation of the
Law.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-O9 href="__P1N.HTM#$O9">341</a></sup></font> Yet Jesus could not help but offend the teachers of the Law,
for he was not content to propose his interpretation alongside theirs but
taught the people &quot;as one who had authority, and not as their
scribes&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-OA href="__P1N.HTM#$OA">342</a></sup></font> In Jesus, the same Word of God that had resounded on
Mount Sinai to give the written Law to Moses, made itself heard anew on the
Mount of the Beatitudes.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-OB href="__P1N.HTM#$OB">343</a></sup></font> Jesus did not abolish the Law but fulfilled
it by giving its ultimate interpretation in a divine way: &quot;You have heard
that it was said to the men of old. . . But I say to you. . .&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-OC href="__P1N.HTM#$OC">344</a></sup></font>
With this same divine authority, he disavowed certain human traditions of the
Pharisees that were &quot;making void the word of God&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-OD href="__P1N.HTM#$OD">345</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>582
Going
even further, Jesus perfects the dietary law, so important in Jewish daily
life, by revealing its pedagogical meaning through a divine interpretation:
&quot;Whatever goes into a man from outside cannot defile him. . . (Thus he
declared all foods clean.). . . What comes out of a man is what defiles a man.
For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts. .
.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-OE href="__P1N.HTM#$OE">346</a></sup></font> In presenting with divine authority the definitive interpretation
of the Law, Jesus found himself confronted by certain teachers of the Law who
did not accept his interpretation of the Law, guaranteed though it was by the
divine signs that accompanied it.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-OF href="__P1N.HTM#$OF">347</a></sup></font> This was the case especially with
the sabbath laws, for he recalls, often with rabbinical arguments, that the
sabbath rest is not violated by serving God and neighbour,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-OG href="__P1N.HTM#$OG">348</a></sup></font> which his
own healings did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>II. JESUS
AND THE TEMPLE</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>583
Like the prophets before him Jesus expressed the deepest respect for the Temple
in Jerusalem. It was in the Temple that Joseph and Mary presented him forty
days after his birth.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-OH href="__P1N.HTM#$OH">349</a></sup></font> At the age of twelve he decided to remain in
the Temple to remind his parents that he must be about his Father's business.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-OI href="__P1N.HTM#$OI">350</a></sup></font>
He went there each year during his hidden life at least for
Passover.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-OJ href="__P1N.HTM#$OJ">351</a></sup></font> His public ministry itself was patterned by his
pilgrimages to Jerusalem for the great Jewish feasts.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-OK href="__P1N.HTM#$OK">352</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>584
Jesus went up to the Temple as the privileged place of encounter with God. For
him, the Temple was the dwelling of his Father, a house of prayer, and he was
angered that its outer court had become a place of commerce.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-OL href="__P1N.HTM#$OL">353</a></sup></font> He
drove merchants out of it because of jealous love for his Father: &quot;You
shall not make my Father's house a house of trade. His disciples remembered
that it was written, 'Zeal for your house will consume me.'&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-OM href="__P1N.HTM#$OM">354</a></sup></font>
After his Resurrection his apostles retained their reverence for the Temple.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-ON href="__P1N.HTM#$ON">355</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>585
On the threshold of his Passion Jesus announced the coming destruction of this
splendid building, of which there would not remain &quot;one stone upon
another&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-OO href="__P1N.HTM#$OO">356</a></sup></font> By doing so, he announced a sign of the last days,
which were to begin with his own Passover.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-OP href="__P1N.HTM#$OP">357</a></sup></font> But this prophecy would
be distorted in its telling by false witnesses during his interrogation at the
high priest's house, and would be thrown back at him as an insult when he was
nailed to the cross.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-OQ href="__P1N.HTM#$OQ">358</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>586
Far from having been hostile to the Temple, where he gave the essential part of
his teaching, Jesus was willing to pay the Temple-tax, associating with him
Peter, whom he had just made the foundation of his future Church.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-OR href="__P1N.HTM#$OR">359</a></sup></font> He
even identified himself with the Temple by presenting himself as God's
definitive dwelling-place among men.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-OS href="__P1N.HTM#$OS">360</a></sup></font> Therefore his being put to
bodily death<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-OT href="__P1N.HTM#$OT">361</a></sup></font> presaged the destruction of the Temple, which would
manifest the dawning of a new age in the history of salvation: &quot;The hour
is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the
Father.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-OU href="__P1N.HTM#$OU">362</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>III. JESUS
AND ISRAEL'S FAITH IN THE ONE GOD AND SAVIOUR</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>587
If the Law and the Jerusalem Temple could be occasions of opposition to Jesus
by Israel's religious authorities, his role in the redemption of sins, the
divine work par excellence, was the true stumbling-block for them.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-OV href="__P1N.HTM#$OV">363</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>588
Jesus scandalized the Pharisees by eating with tax collectors and sinners as
familiarly as with themselves.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-OW href="__P1N.HTM#$OW">364</a></sup></font> Against those among them &quot;who
trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others&quot;, Jesus
affirmed: &quot;I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to
repentance.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-OX href="__P1N.HTM#$OX">365</a></sup></font> He went further by proclaiming before the
Pharisees that, since sin is universal, those who pretend not to need salvation
are blind to themselves.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-OY href="__P1N.HTM#$OY">366</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>589
Jesus gave scandal above all when he identified his merciful conduct toward
sinners with God's own attitude toward them.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-OZ href="__P1N.HTM#$OZ">367</a></sup></font> He went so far as to
hint that by sharing the table of sinners he was admitting them to the
messianic banquet.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-P0 href="__P1N.HTM#$P0">368</a></sup></font> But it was most especially by forgiving sins that
Jesus placed the religious authorities of Israel on the horns of a dilemma.
Were they not entitled to demand in consternation, &quot;Who can forgive sins
but God alone?&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-P1 href="__P1N.HTM#$P1">369</a></sup></font> By forgiving sins Jesus either is blaspheming
as a man who made himself God's equal, or is speaking the truth and his person
really does make present and reveal God's name.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-P2 href="__P1N.HTM#$P2">370</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>590
Only the divine identity of Jesus' person can justify so absolute a claim as
&quot;He who is not with me is against me&quot;; and his saying that there was
in him &quot;something greater than Jonah,. . . greater than Solomon&quot;,
something &quot;greater than the Temple&quot;; his reminder that David had
called the Messiah his Lord,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-P3 href="__P1N.HTM#$P3">371</a></sup></font> and his affirmations, &quot;Before
Abraham was, I AM&quot;, and even &quot;I and the Father are one.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-P4 href="__P1N.HTM#$P4">372</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>591
Jesus asked the religious authorities of Jerusalem to believe in him because of
the Father's works which he accomplished.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-P5 href="__P1N.HTM#$P5">373</a></sup></font> But such an act of faith
must go through a mysterious death to self, for a new &quot;birth from above&quot;
under the influence of divine grace.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-P6 href="__P1N.HTM#$P6">374</a></sup></font> Such a demand for conversion in
the face of so surprising a fulfilment of the promises<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-P7 href="__P1N.HTM#$P7">375</a></sup></font> allows one to
understand the Sanhedrin's tragic misunderstanding of Jesus: they judged that
he deserved the death sentence as a blasphemer.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-P8 href="__P1N.HTM#$P8">376</a></sup></font> The members of the
Sanhedrin were thus acting at the same time out of &quot;ignorance&quot; and
the &quot;hardness&quot; of their &quot;unbelief&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-P9 href="__P1N.HTM#$P9">377</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>IN BRIEF</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>592 Jesus did not abolish the
Law of Sinai, but rather fulfilled it (cf Mt
5:17-19) with such perfection (cf Jn
8:46) that he revealed its ultimate meaning (cf
Mt 5:33) and redeemed the transgressions
against it (cf Heb 9:15).</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>593 Jesus venerated the
Temple by going up to it for the Jewish feasts of pilgrimage, and with a
jealous love he loved this dwelling of God among men. the Temple prefigures his
own mystery. When he announces its destruction, it is as a manifestation of his
own execution and of the entry into a new age in the history of salvation, when
his Body would be the definitive Temple.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>594 Jesus performed acts,
such as pardoning sins, that manifested him to be the Saviour God himself (cf
Jn 5:16-18). Certain Jews, who did not
recognize God made man (cf Jn 1:14), saw in
him only a man who made himself God (Jn
10:33), and judged him as a blasphemer.</i></p>
