Social Justice</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2426
The development of economic activity and growth in production are meant to
provide for the needs of human beings. Economic life is not meant solely to
multiply goods produced and increase profit or power; it is ordered first of
all to the service of persons, of the whole man, and of the entire human
community. Economic activity, conducted according to its own proper methods, is
to be exercised within the limits of the moral order, in keeping with social
justice so as to correspond to God's plan for man.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2G0 href="__P8D.HTM#$2G0">208</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2427
Human work proceeds directly from persons created in the image of God and
called to prolong the work of creation by subduing the earth, both with and for
one another.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2G1 href="__P8D.HTM#$2G1">209</a></sup></font> Hence work is a duty: &quot;If any one will not work,
let him not eat.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2G2 href="__P8D.HTM#$2G2">210</a></sup></font> Work honors the Creator's gifts and the
talents received from him. It can also be redemptive. By enduring the hardship
of work<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2G3 href="__P8D.HTM#$2G3">211</a></sup></font> in union with Jesus, the carpenter of Nazareth and the one
crucified on Calvary, man collaborates in a certain fashion with the Son of God
in his redemptive work. He shows himself to be a disciple of Christ by carrying
the cross, daily, in the work he is called to accomplish.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2G4 href="__P8D.HTM#$2G4">212</a></sup></font> Work can
be a means of sanctification and a way of animating earthly realities with the
Spirit of Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2428
In work, the person exercises and fulfills in part the potential inscribed in
his nature. the primordial value of labor stems from man himself, its author
and its beneficiary. Work is for man, not man for work.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2G5 href="__P8D.HTM#$2G5">213</a></sup></font> <br>
Everyone should be able to draw from work the means of providing for his life
and that of his family, and of serving the human community.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2429
Everyone has the right of economic initiative; everyone should make legitimate
use of his talents to contribute to the abundance that will benefit all and to
harvest the just fruits of his labor. He should seek to observe regulations issued
by legitimate authority for the sake of the common good.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2G6 href="__P8D.HTM#$2G6">214</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2430
Economic life brings into play different interests, often opposed to one
another. This explains why the conflicts that characterize it arise.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2G7 href="__P8D.HTM#$2G7">215</a></sup></font>
Efforts should be made to reduce these conflicts by negotiation that respects
the rights and duties of each social partner: those responsible for business
enterprises, representatives of wage - earners (for example, trade unions), and
public authorities when appropriate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2431
The responsibility of the state. &quot;Economic activity, especially the
activity of a market economy, cannot be conducted in an institutional,
juridical, or political vacuum. On the contrary, it presupposes sure guarantees
of individual freedom and private property, as well as a stable currency and
efficient public services. Hence the principal task of the state is to
guarantee this security, so that those who work and produce can enjoy the
fruits of their labors and thus feel encouraged to work efficiently and
honestly.... Another task of the state is that of overseeing and directing the
exercise of human rights in the economic sector. However, primary
responsibility in this area belongs not to the state but to individuals and to
the various groups and associations which make up society.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2G8 href="__P8D.HTM#$2G8">216</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2432
Those responsible for business enterprises are responsible to society for the
economic and ecological effects of their operations.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2G9 href="__P8D.HTM#$2G9">217</a></sup></font> They have an
obligation to consider the good of persons and not only the increase of
profits. Profits are necessary, however. They make possible the investments
that ensure the future of a business and they guarantee employment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2433
Access to employment and to professions must be open to all without unjust
discrimination: men and women, healthy and disabled, natives and
immigrants.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2GA href="__P8D.HTM#$2GA">218</a></sup></font> For its part society should, according to circumstances,
help citizens find work and employment.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2GB href="__P8D.HTM#$2GB">219</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2434
A just wage is the legitimate fruit of work. To refuse or withhold it can be a
grave injustice.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2GC href="__P8D.HTM#$2GC">220</a></sup></font> In determining fair pay both the needs and the
contributions of each person must be taken into account. &quot;Remuneration for
work should guarantee man the opportunity to provide a dignified livelihood for
himself and his family on the material, social, cultural and spiritual level,
taking into account the role and the productivity of each, the state of the
business, and the common good.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2GD href="__P8D.HTM#$2GD">221</a></sup></font> Agreement between the parties
is not sufficient to justify morally the amount to be received in wages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2435
Recourse to a strike is morally legitimate when it cannot be avoided, or at
least when it is necessary to obtain a proportionate benefit. It becomes
morally unacceptable when accompanied by violence, or when objectives are
included that are not directly linked to working conditions or are contrary to
the common good. <br>
2436 Unemployment almost always wounds its victim's dignity
and threatens the equilibrium of his life. Besides the harm done to him
personally, it entails many risks for his family.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2GE href="__P8D.HTM#$2GE">222</a></sup></font></p>
