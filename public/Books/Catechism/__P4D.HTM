<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>VII. </b><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>The Acts of the
Penitent</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1450
&quot;Penance requires . . . the sinner to endure all things willingly, be
contrite of heart, confess with the lips, and practice complete humility and
fruitful satisfaction.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1PD href="__P4D.HTM#$1PD">49</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Contrition</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1451
Among the penitent's acts contrition occupies first place. Contrition is
&quot;sorrow of the soul and detestation for the sin committed, together with
the resolution not to sin again.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1PE href="__P4D.HTM#$1PE">50</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1452
When it arises from a love by which God is loved above all else, contrition is
called &quot;perfect&quot; (contrition of charity). Such contrition remits
venial sins; it also obtains forgiveness of mortal sins if it includes the firm
resolution to have recourse to sacramental confession as soon as
possible.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1PF href="__P4D.HTM#$1PF">51</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1453
The contrition called &quot;imperfect&quot; (or &quot;attrition&quot;) is also
a gift of God, a prompting of the Holy Spirit. It is born of the consideration
of sin's ugliness or the fear of eternal damnation and the other penalties
threatening the sinner (contrition of fear). Such a stirring of conscience can
initiate an interior process which, under the prompting of grace, will be
brought to completion by sacramental absolution. By itself however, imperfect
contrition cannot obtain the forgiveness of grave sins, but it disposes one to
obtain forgiveness in the sacrament of Penance.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1PG href="__P4D.HTM#$1PG">52</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1454
The
reception of this sacrament ought to be prepared for by an examination of
conscience made in the light of the Word of God. the passages best suited to
this can be found in the moral catechesis of the Gospels and the apostolic
Letters, such as the Sermon on the Mount and the apostolic teachings.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1PH href="__P4D.HTM#$1PH">53</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The
confession of sins</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1455
The confession (or disclosure) of sins, even from a simply human point of view,
frees us and facilitates our reconciliation with others. Through such an
admission man looks squarely at the sins he is guilty of, takes responsibility
for them, and thereby opens himself again to God and to the communion of the
Church in order to make a new future possible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1456
Confession to a priest is an essential part of the sacrament of Penance:
&quot;All mortal sins of which penitents after a diligent self-examination are
conscious must be recounted by them in confession, even if they are most secret
and have been committed against the last two precepts of the Decalogue; for these
sins sometimes wound the soul more grievously and are more dangerous than those
which are committed openly.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1PI href="__P4D.HTM#$1PI">54</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When Christ's faithful strive to confess all the sins that they can
remember, they undoubtedly place all of them before the divine mercy for
pardon. But those who fail to do so and knowingly withhold some, place nothing
before the divine goodness for remission through the mediation of the priest,
&quot;for if the sick person is too ashamed to show his wound to the doctor,
the medicine cannot heal what it does not know.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1PJ href="__P4D.HTM#$1PJ">55</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1457
According
to the Church's command, &quot;after having attained the age of discretion,
each of the faithful is bound by an obligation faithfully to confess serious
sins at least once a year.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1PK href="__P4D.HTM#$1PK">56</a></sup></font> Anyone who is aware of having
committed a mortal sin must not receive Holy Communion, even if he experiences
deep contrition, without having first received sacramental absolution, unless
he has a grave reason for receiving Communion and there is no possibility of
going to confession.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1PL href="__P4D.HTM#$1PL">57</a></sup></font> Children must go to the sacrament of Penance
before receiving Holy Communion for the first time.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1PM href="__P4D.HTM#$1PM">58</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1458
Without being strictly necessary, confession of everyday faults (venial sins) is
nevertheless strongly recommended by the Church.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1PN href="__P4D.HTM#$1PN">59</a></sup></font> Indeed the regular
confession of our venial sins helps us form our conscience, fight against evil
tendencies, let ourselves be healed by Christ and progress in the life of the
Spirit. By receiving more frequently through this sacrament the gift of the
Father's mercy, we are spurred to be merciful as he is merciful:<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1PO href="__P4D.HTM#$1PO">60</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>Whoever confesses his sins . .
. is already working with God. God indicts your sins; if you also indict them,
you are joined with God. Man and sinner are, so to speak, two realities: when
you hear &quot;man&quot; - this is what God has made; when you hear
&quot;sinner&quot; - this is what man himself has made. Destroy what you have
made, so that God may save what he has made .... When you begin to abhor what
you have made, it is then that your good works are beginning, since you are
accusing yourself of your evil works. the beginning of good works is the
confession of evil works. You do the truth and come to the light.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1PP href="__P4D.HTM#$1PP">61</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Satisfaction</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1459
Many sins wrong our neighbor. One must do what is possible in order to repair
the harm (e.g., return stolen goods, restore the reputation of someone
slandered, pay compensation for injuries). Simple justice requires as much. But
sin also injures and weakens the sinner himself, as well as his relationships
with God and neighbor. Absolution takes away sin, but it does not remedy all
the disorders sin has caused.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1PQ href="__P4D.HTM#$1PQ">62</a></sup></font> Raised up from sin, the sinner must
still recover his full spiritual health by doing something more to make amends
for the sin: he must &quot;make satisfaction for&quot; or &quot;expiate&quot;
his sins. This satisfaction is also called &quot;penance.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1460
The penance the confessor imposes must take into account the penitent's personal
situation and must seek his spiritual good. It must correspond as far as
possible with the gravity and nature of the sins committed. It can consist of
prayer, an offering, works of mercy, service of neighbor, voluntary
self-denial, sacrifices, and above all the patient acceptance of the cross we
must bear. Such penances help configure us to Christ, who alone expiated our
sins once for all. They allow us to become co-heirs with the risen Christ,
&quot;provided we suffer with him.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1PR href="__P4D.HTM#$1PR">63</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>The satisfaction that we make
for our sins, however, is not so much ours as though it were not done through
Jesus Christ. We who can do nothing ourselves, as if just by ourselves, can do
all things with the cooperation of &quot;him who strengthens&quot; us. Thus man
has nothing of which to boast, but all our boasting is in Christ . . . in whom
we make satisfaction by bringing forth &quot;fruits that befit
repentance.&quot; These fruits have their efficacy from him, by him they are
offered to the Father, and through him they are accepted by the
Father.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1PS href="__P4D.HTM#$1PS">64</a></sup></font></p>
