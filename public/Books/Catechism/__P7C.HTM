<p class=MsoNormal>2084
God makes himself known by recalling his all-powerful loving, and liberating
action in the history of the one he addresses: &quot;I brought you out of the
land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.&quot; the first word contains the
first commandment of the Law: &quot;You shall fear the LORD your God; you shall
serve him.... You shall not go after other gods.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-26W href="__P7C.HTM#$26W">5</a></sup></font> God's first
call and just demand is that man accept him and worship him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2085
The one and true God first reveals his glory to Israel.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-26X href="__P7C.HTM#$26X">6</a></sup></font> The revelation
of the vocation and truth of man is linked to the revelation of God. Man's
vocation is to make God manifest by acting in conformity with his creation
&quot;in the image and likeness of God&quot;:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>There will never be another
God, Trypho, and there has been no other since the world began . . . than he
who made and ordered the universe. We do not think that our God is different
from yours. He is the same who brought your fathers out of Egypt &quot;by his
powerful hand and his outstretched arm.&quot; We do not place our hope in some
other god, for there is none, but in the same God as you do: the God of
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-26Y href="__P7C.HTM#$26Y">7</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2086
&quot;The first commandment embraces faith, hope, and charity. When we say
'God' we confess a constant, unchangeable being, always the same, faithful and
just, without any evil. It follows that we must necessarily accept his words
and have complete faith in him and acknowledge his authority. He is almighty,
merciful, and infinitely beneficent. Who could not place all hope in him? Who
could not love him when contemplating the treasures of goodness and love he has
poured out on us? Hence the formula God employs in the Scripture at the
beginning and end of his commandments: 'I am the LORD.'&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-26Z href="__P7C.HTM#$26Z">8</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Faith</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2087
Our moral life has its source in faith in God who reveals his love to us. St.
Paul speaks of the &quot;obedience of faith&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-270 href="__P7C.HTM#$270">9</a></sup></font> as our first
obligation. He shows that &quot;ignorance of God&quot; is the principle and
explanation of all moral deviations.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-271 href="__P7C.HTM#$271">10</a></sup></font> Our duty toward God is to
believe in him and to bear witness to him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2088
The first commandment requires us to nourish and protect our faith with
prudence and vigilance, and to reject everything that is opposed to it. There
are various ways of sinning against faith: <br>
Voluntary doubt about the faith disregards or refuses to hold as true what God
has revealed and the Church proposes for belief. Involuntary doubt refers to
hesitation in believing, difficulty in overcoming objections connected with the
faith, or also anxiety aroused by its obscurity. If deliberately cultivated
doubt can lead to spiritual blindness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2089
Incredulity is the neglect of revealed truth or the willful refusal to assent
to it. &quot;Heresy is the obstinate post-baptismal denial of some truth which
must be believed with divine and catholic faith, or it is likewise an obstinate
doubt concerning the same; apostasy is the total repudiation of the Christian
faith; schism is the refusal of submission to the Roman Pontiff or of communion
with the members of the Church subject to him.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-272 href="__P7C.HTM#$272">11</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hope</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2090
When God reveals Himself and calls him, man cannot fully respond to the divine
love by his own powers. He must hope that God will give him the capacity to
love Him in return and to act in conformity with the commandments of charity.
Hope is the confident expectation of divine blessing and the beatific vision of
God; it is also the fear of offending God's love and of incurring punishment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2091
The first commandment is also concerned with sins against hope, namely, despair
and presumption: <br>
By despair, man ceases to hope for his personal salvation from God, for help in
attaining it or for the forgiveness of his sins. Despair is contrary to God's
goodness, to his justice - for the Lord is faithful to his promises - and to
his mercy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2092
There are two kinds of presumption. Either man presumes upon his own
capacities, (hoping to be able to save himself without help from on high), or
he presumes upon God's almighty power or his mercy (hoping to obtain his
forgiveness without conversion and glory without merit).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Charity</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2093
Faith in God's love encompasses the call and the obligation to respond with sincere
love to divine charity. the first commandment enjoins us to love God above
everything and all creatures for him and because of him.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-273 href="__P7C.HTM#$273">12</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2094
One can sin against God's love in various ways: <br>
- indifference neglects or refuses to reflect on divine charity; it fails to
consider its prevenient goodness and denies its power. <br>
- ingratitude fails or refuses to acknowledge divine charity and to return him
love for love. <br>
- lukewarmness is hesitation or negligence in responding to divine love; it can
imply refusal to give oneself over to the prompting of charity. <br>
- acedia or spiritual sloth goes so far as to refuse the joy that comes from
God and to be repelled by divine goodness. <br>
- hatred of God comes from pride. It is contrary to love of God, whose goodness
it denies, and whom it presumes to curse as the one who forbids sins and
inflicts punishments.</p>
